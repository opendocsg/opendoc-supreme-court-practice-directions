(2) Where appropriate, parties or their solicitors may be required to attend in person to take directions on the conduct of the appeal.

## 87. Filing of records of appeal, core bundles and written Cases for civil appeals under Order 57, Rules 9 and 9A of the Rules of Court

(1) Under Order 57, Rule 9(1) of the Rules of Court, the appellant is required to file the record of appeal, the Appellant’s Case and the core bundle.

########################################################################## -->

For the avoidance of doubt, the documents contained in the hard copies of the appeal bundles must coincide with the documents listed in the form of the appeal bundles.

(4) The attention of parties is also drawn to the Court fees payable under Order 90B read with Appendix B of the Rules of Court, and the importance of brevity and restraint in the compilation of core bundles.

(4A) The Chief Justice has further directed that the Appellant’s Case and the Respondent’s Case in civil matters before the Court of Appeal shall not exceed 50 pages unless leave of the Court of Appeal is obtained. The Appellant’s Reply, if any, shall not exceed 30 pages unless leave of the Court of Appeal is obtained. The process for obtaining leave of the Court of Appeal may be found in paragraph 87A of these Practice Directions. Any Appellant’s Case, Respondent’s Case, and Appellant’s Reply in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages. Parties are reminded to comply with Order 57, Rule 9A of the Rules of Court in respect of the preparation of their Cases, and the Appellant’s Reply, as well as the following requirements:

: (a) all pages should be paginated, with the page numbers corresponding to the Portable Document Format version of the Case or the Appellant’s Reply, as the case may be;

(5) If a party wishes to rely on a document which does not exist in the electronic case file, he must file the document <span style="font-style: italic;">*together*</span> with the respective forms of appeal bundles. Further, a table of contents must be included for these documents. These documents must be paginated consecutively at the centre top of the page and the solicitor must ensure that the pagination takes into account the pages comprising the respective forms of appeal bundles and the table of contents for these additional documents. For example, if the form of the core bundle is 5 pages and the table of contents for the additional documents is 2 pages, the first page of the first document should be paginated as page 8. 

(6) When the core bundles and supplemental core bundles are tendered at the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court pursuant to paragraph 88(1), the Legal Registry staff will state on the top right hand corner of the bundle the exact amount of Court fees payable under Order 90B. The parties should then pay the Court fees as indicated.

## 87A. Request for leave to exceed page limit for Appellant’s Case, Respondent’s Case and Appellant's Reply for civil appeals to the Court of Appeal

(1) Parties shall apply for leave of the Court of Appeal to exceed the page limit for the Appellant’s Case, the Respondent’s Case or the Appellant's Reply by filing a Request in the Electronic Filing Service stating the reasons for requiring additional pages and the number of additional pages required.

The affidavit in Form 14A must verify Form 14B of Appendix A of these Practice Directions.

## 88. Hard copies and soft copies for hearing of civil appeals before the Court of Appeal under Order 57 of the Rules of Court

(1) In order to assist the Judges of the Court of Appeal, the appellant and the respondent are required to tender hard copies of the Appellant’s and Respondent’s Cases, the Appellant’s Reply (if any), core bundles of documents and supplemental core bundles of documents (if any) to the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court at the same time when filing them within the prescribed time under Order 57, Rule 9A of the Rules of Court. The following directions must be complied with:

: (a) Where the appeal is to be heard by a 3-judge Court, 4 hard copies of the Cases and the Appellant’s Reply (if any), the core bundles and supplemental core bundles of documents (if any) shall be tendered.

## 89. Preparation of appeal records in civil appeals to the Court of Appeal

***Arrangement***

(1) This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of arranging appeal records.

: (a) To facilitate cross-referencing, appeal records shall be arranged in the following separate volumes:

<!-- #########################################################################
TODO: Add formatting for nested points
########################################################################## -->

: (i) **Volume I** – Judgment or grounds of decision and the engrossed order of Court of judgment appealed from.

: (ii) **Volume I** – Notice of appeal, certificate of security for costs and pleadings (to include all originating processes).

: (iii) **Volume III** – Affidavits (in chronological order), and transcripts or notes of evidence and arguments.

: (iv) **Volume IV** – All such exhibits and documents as they were tendered in the Court below, but which did not form an exhibit to any affidavit.

: (v) **Volume V** – The Agreed Bundle (if any) in its original physical form as it was tendered in the Court below.

: (b) Where there are no exhibits or documents referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(a)(iv) above, Volume IV need not be produced, and Volume V shall be renumbered as Volume IV.

: (c) If any volume should exceed 300 pages, then that volume shall be sub-divided, at a convenient page, into sub-volumes designated as part thereof, for example, Volume III Part A, Volume III Part B and so on. Conversely, if any of the volumes (with the exception of Volumes I and II which shall remain as separate volumes) should be less than 100 pages each, these may be amalgamated into combined volumes, each not exceeding 300 pages, and renumbered accordingly.

: (d) The following additional directions shall apply to the form of the record of appeal:

<!-- #########################################################################
TODO: Add formatting for nested points
########################################################################## -->

: (i) The documents in Volumes I, II, and III shall be arranged strictly in the order stated in sub-paragraph (1)(a) above.

: (ii) The documentary exhibits in Volume IV shall be arranged in the most convenient way for the use of the Court, as the circumstances of the case require. The documents shall, as far as suitable, be arranged in chronological order, mixing plaintiff’s and defendant’s documents together when necessary (for example, in a series of correspondence). If proceedings in a suit other than the one under appeal appear as exhibits, then these shall be kept together. However, the documents from each suit shall be arranged in the chronological order of the suits.

: (iii) Each document in Volume IV shall show its exhibit mark and whether it is the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s document, unless this is clear from the mark.

***Pagination in soft copy***

(2) This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of paginating soft copy appeal records.

: (a) The first page of each volume shall state the title and the Civil Appeal number of the appeal, the names of the parties, the volume number, a short description of its contents, the names and addresses of the appellants and respondents, and the date of filing.

: (b) The page number of each volume of the appeal records must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that volume. Each separate volume of the appeal records shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively. If separator sheets are used, these shall also be numbered<span style="margin-left: 40px;">.</span>

***Table of contents***

(3) This sub-paragraph sets out the format of the table of contents for appeal records.

: (a) The table of contents of all volumes of the records shall be placed at the beginning of Volume I, immediately after the first title page in the manner and form set out in Form 15 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions.

: (b) Each volume and, if any, parts thereof, shall also contain its own index of the contents.

: (c) Items in the table of contents shall be numbered serially, and listed in the order in which they are found in the records.

: (d) The items relating to the transcripts or notes of the evidence of witnesses shall have a sub-table of contents of the evidence of each witness, and the number and name of each witness shall be shown in such sub-table.

: (e) If an exhibit consists of a bundle of documents, then the documents in the bundle shall be listed in a sub-table of contents under the item relating to such bundle.

: (f) Electronic bookmarks for each item of the table of contents and sub-table of contents must be added to each volume of the PDF version of the appeal records. The description of each bookmark shall correspond with the description of that item in the table of contents or sub-table of contents, unless an abbreviated description is appropriate. 

***Spacing***

(4) The line spacing on every page of the records of which the original is typed-written (for example, notice of appeal) shall be double-spaced.

***Core bundles – Order 57, Rule 9(2A)***

(5) The documents to be included in the core bundle are stipulated in Order 57, Rule 9(2A).  The contents of the core bundle shall be arranged in the following separate volumes:

: (a) **Volume I** – a copy of the grounds of the judgment or order, the judgment or order appealed from and an index of the documents included therein.

: (b) **Volume II** – all other documents referred to in Order 57, Rule 9(2A), and an index of the documents included therein.

Each volume of the core bundle shall begin at page 1, every page shall be numbered and the page number of the core bundle shall correspond to the page number of the PDF version.

***Index of core bundles and supplemental core bundles***

(5A) The indexes of the core bundle and supplemental core bundle shall correspond with the indexes of documents found in the form of core bundle and form of supplemental core bundle filed under paragraph 87(2) of these Practice Directions. Any document listed in the indexes should be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the Court to identify the nature of the document. Examples of suitable descriptions are set out below for reference:

: (a) Joint Venture Agreement between Party A and Party B dated 1 December 2017;

: (b) Minutes of meeting held on 1 December 2017 between Party A and Party B; and

: (c) Email dated 1 December 2017 from Party A and Party B.

Parties should avoid the use of generic descriptions such as “extracts from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017” or “exhibits from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017”.

***Responsibility for good order and completeness of appeal records***

(6) The solicitor having the conduct of the appeal may delegate the preparation of the appeal records to an assistant or a suitably experienced law clerk or secretary, provided always that the solicitor shall personally satisfy himself as to the good order and completeness of every copy of the appeal records lodged in Court in accordance with the above directions, and shall personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies.

***Superfluous and irrelevant documents***

(7) With regard to the inclusion of documents, the solicitor’s attention is drawn to the provisions of Order 57, Rules 9(2), (2A) and (3). Only documents which are relevant to the subject matter of the appeal, or, in the case of core bundles, will be referred to in the Cases, shall be included in the appeal records. The Court of Appeal will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs in cases in which it is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of superfluous or irrelevant documents. Documents shall not appear more than once in the records, even if exhibited to different affidavits.

## 89A. Bundle of documents filed with leave of the Court of Appeal

(1) Where leave is granted by the Court of Appeal for the filing of any bundle of documents under Order 57, Rule 9A(23), the party shall file the bundle of documents by tendering the requisite hard copies of the bundle of documents to the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court in accordance with paragraph 88(1) of these Practice Directions. 

(2) In addition to hard copies, the party filing the bundle of documents is required to tender soft copies of the bundle of documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) at the same time in a CD-ROM in accordance with paragraphs 88(4) and (5) of these Practice Directions.

(3) When the bundle of documents is tendered at the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court pursuant to this paragraph, the Legal Registry staff will state on the top right hand corner of the bundle the exact amount of Court fees payable under Order 90B.  The parties should then pay the Court fees as indicated.

(4) The directions set out in paragraph 89 of these Practice Directions in relation to the preparation of the bundles shall, with the necessary modifications, apply to the bundle of documents.

## 90. Skeletal arguments for appeals before the High Court, Court of Appeal and Court of 3 Judges

(1) For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph applies to:

: (a) civil and criminal appeals in the High Court, excluding appeals from the Registrar to a Judge in Chambers;

: (b) civil appeals and any other civil matters, including interlocutory applications, before the Court of Appeal; and

: (c) criminal appeals and other criminal matters before the Court of Appeal.

(2) The term “skeletal arguments” includes “skeletal submissions”, “written submissions”, “written arguments” and all other variant terms by which such documents are known.

(3) Counsel should submit skeletal arguments for the hearing of the appeal or matter and give a copy to counsel for the other parties. Hard copies of skeletal arguments may be printed on one side or both sides of each page.

(4) Skeletal arguments are abbreviated notes of the arguments that will be presented. Skeletal arguments are not formal documents and do not bind parties. They are a valuable tool to the Judges and are meant to expedite the hearing of the appeal. These notes should comply with the following requirements:

: (a) they should contain a numbered list of the points proposed to be argued, stated in no more than one or 2 sentences;

: (b) each listed point should be accompanied by a full reference to the material to which counsel will be  referring, i.e., the relevant pages or passages in authorities, the record of appeal, the bundles of documents, affidavits, transcripts and the judgment under appeal;

: (c) all pages should be paginated, with the first page (not including any cover page) numbered as “Page 1”;

: (d) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent;

: (e) the print of every page shall be double-spaced; and

: (f) every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35mm in width.

***Skeletal arguments for civil matters before the Court of Appeal***

(5) The need for parties to avoid prolixity in their “skeletal arguments” is emphasised. All skeletal arguments in civil matters before the Court of Appeal shall not exceed 20 pages. Any skeletal arguments in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages.

(6) Where the appeal or matter is before the Court of Appeal, the skeletal arguments must be filed by 4 p.m. on the Monday three weeks before the week of the Court of Appeal sitting (e.g., the skeletal arguments for the Court of Appeal sitting in the week of 8 April 2013 must be filed by 4 p.m. on 18 March 2013). The skeletal arguments should be filed by tendering 4 hard copies to the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court and filing one soft copy through the Electronic Filing Service. Skeletal arguments filed in breach of this timeline will be rejected. For the avoidance of doubt, this timeline applies regardless of the actual day on which the particular appeal is scheduled for hearing before the Court of Appeal.

(7) As with other non-compliance with timelines, costs may be imposed against the party in default or his counsel personally in the event of non-compliance with sub-paragraph (6) above.  Unless approval for late filing has been granted, the party in default may not file or tender these skeletal arguments in Court.

(8) Parties whose skeletal arguments have been rejected for filing may re-file their skeletal arguments, provided they comply with sub-paragraphs (4) to (7) above.

***Further skeletal arguments for civil and criminal matters before the Court of Appeal***

(8A) Where the Court of Appeal orders further skeletal arguments (including any submissions on costs) to be filed for any civil or criminal matter, such skeletal arguments shall not exceed 10 pages unless otherwise directed by the Court of Appeal. Any skeletal arguments filed in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages.

***Timelines for submission of skeletal arguments for appeal before the High Court***

(9) Where the appeal is a civil appeal before the High Court, the skeletal arguments should be sent to the Legal Registry at least 2 working days before the hearing of the appeal.

(10) Where the appeal is a criminal appeal before the High Court, the skeletal arguments should be sent to the Legal Registry at least 10 days before the hearing of the appeal. Skeletal arguments filed in breach of this timeline will be stamped “Late Submission”. 

***Application of this paragraph to Court of 3 Judges***

(11) Sub-paragraphs (1) to (8A) also apply to disciplinary proceedings, or appeals therefrom, brought under any statute, including the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161) and the Medical Registration Act (Cap. 174) which are heard by a Court of 3 Judges.

## 91\. Use of presentation slides for all proceedings before the High Court, Court of Appeal and Court of 3 Judges

Subject to approval by the Court, parties may utilise presentation slides to assist in oral submissions before the Court. Presentation slides may be projected in the courtroom or hearing chambers when oral submissions are made. Presentation slides shall comply with the following standards:

***Typeface***

(1) A clear typeface such as Arial or Times New Roman should be used; care should be taken to ensure that the font used is of at least a size equivalent to Arial font size 32. Bold and italicised fonts should be used sparingly.

***Colours***

(2) There should be sufficient contrast between the slide background and text: it is preferable to use black or dark fonts with a light background. The colours used in slide backgrounds should be muted and preferably monochromatic.

***Animation and sounds***

(3) Animation of slides or elements within a slide should be avoided; similarly, sounds should not be incorporated in the presentation slides unless they are necessary.

***Corporate logos***

(4) Corporate logos of the law practice may be displayed on the presentation slides. Care should be taken to ensure that the size and location of corporate logos do not distract from the substance of the presentation slides. 

## 92. Further arguments before the Court of Appeal

(1) From time to time, requests are received for further arguments to be presented before the Court of Appeal after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal. Such requests should not be made as all relevant arguments should have been presented at the hearing proper. 

(2) The Honourable the Chief Justice has therefore directed that as a general rule, unless asked for by the Court of Appeal itself, the Court of Appeal will not receive further arguments after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal.

(3) The general rule will be relaxed in only very exceptional circumstances, e.g., if an authority not available at the hearing would be decisive. Counsel seeking to submit further arguments should therefore satisfy themselves that very exceptional circumstances exist. If they are of the view that such circumstances do exist, they must also seek the consent of the other parties to their request.

(4) All requests for further arguments shall be made by filing a Request through the Electronic Filing Service and should:

: (a) state the party making the requests;

: (b) identify the Judges constituting the Court of Appeal who heard the matter in question;

: (c) specify when the order concerned was made;

: (d) state the very exceptional reasons which justify the request;

: (e) state whether the other parties consent to the request;

: (f) set out the proposed further arguments briefly, together with any authorities; and

: (g) include a copy of each of the authorities cited.

(5) Any request for further arguments must be received by the Registrar within one week after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, failing which it cannot be considered and will be rejected. 

(6) A copy of the request should be furnished to all parties concerned.

(7) All requests should be addressed to the Registrar.
