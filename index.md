# Practice Directions
Practice Directions and Registrar's Circulars are issued by the courts to supplement the Rules of Court by regulating court practice and procedure. Court users are expected to comply with all Practice Directions and Registrar's Circulars issued by the court. Until 1994, Practice Directions were issued as discrete documents; since then, however, all Practice Directions have been consolidated into a publication known as The Supreme Court Practice Directions.
