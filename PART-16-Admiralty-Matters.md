# 124\. Arrest of ships by the Sheriff

(1) The Sheriff will apply to a Judge for an omnibus order in every case
where a ship or vessel is arrested, giving the Sheriff discretion to
take various measures for the safe and satisfactory custody of the
arrested property. The usual terms of the order are that:

(a) the Sheriff may be at liberty at his discretion at any time to take
measures to preserve the ship/vessel, her machinery and equipment;

(b) the Sheriff may be at liberty at his discretion at any time to move
the ship or vessel within the limits of the port where she is lying
under arrest, either for her own safety or to comply with the
requirements of the port authority; and

(c) the costs and expenses incurred in the implementation of the order
be deemed to be part of the Sheriff’s expenses and in the event of a
sale be paid first out of the proceeds of sale.

(2) Solicitors representing plaintiffs in admiralty proceedings are
required to provide an undertaking that the Sheriff shall be indemnified
and be provided with sufficient funds as and when required by the
Sheriff to meet the charges and expenses that may be incurred in
consequence of their request for the arrest of a vessel. If such an
undertaking is not fulfilled within a reasonable time, the Sheriff may
take such steps as may be necessary to enforce the undertaking against
the solicitors concerned.

(3) Upon the arrest of vessel, funds are required immediately to meet
the Sheriff’s expenses, such as guard charges, port and garbage dues,
and the supply of minimum victuals, domestic fuel and water to crew
members where necessary. Funds to meet such expenses are not provided
for by the Government.

(4) To enable the Sheriff to discharge his duties effectively, upon the
arrest of a vessel, the Sheriff may require the solicitors representing
arresting parties to deposit with the Sheriff a sum of between $5,000 to
$10,000. Such deposit is in addition to the usual undertaking..

# 125\. Form of undertaking

In order to ensure that there is no undue delay in the issuance and
execution of warrants of arrest and release as well as commissions for
appraisement and sale, members of the Bar are requested to prepare the
undertaking in accordance with Form 24 of Appendix A of these Practice
Directions.

# 126\. Release of vessel lying under arrest

(1) If the arresting party requires the Sheriff to attend at the port in
which a vessel is lying under arrest for the purpose of releasing the
vessel from arrest, whether during or after office hours, he or she must
do so by filing the requisite Request for attendance electronic form to
the Sheriff through the Electronic Filing Service. A Request for
attendance made in any other manner will not be acceded to.

(2) The fees prescribed by Appendix B to the Rules of Court will be
payable in respect of any attendance by the Sheriff.

# 127\. Filing of supporting documents

The attention of solicitors is drawn to paragraph 9 which sets out the
opening hours of the Legal Registry of Supreme Court. Solicitors shall
ensure that the necessary documents are filed within the opening hours
of the Legal Registry to enable execution to be effected. The directions
in paragraph 11 apply when an urgent application has to be made after
the Legal Registry’s opening hours.

# 128. Hard copies at hearing of admiralty matters

Order 70, Rule 26 of the Rules of Court provides that the party by whom
an admiralty action is set down for trial must file any preliminary act
and a Request for an assessor’s attendance (where applicable) not less
than 7 days before the trial. In addition to this rule, the party must
tender 3 hard copies of the preliminary act(s) to the Legal Registry of
the Supreme Court.

# 129. Searches for caveats against arrest or release

Order 70, Rule 4(2)(b) of the Rules of Court provides that the party
applying for a warrant of arrest to be issued must procure a search to
be made in the record of caveats to ascertain whether there is a caveat
against arrest in force. Order 70, Rule 12(2) provides that a release
shall not be issued if a caveat against release is in force. A party
applying for either arrest or release of a particular property shall
provide documentation evidencing a search for caveats against arrest or
release, as the case may be, reflecting a search done no more than 15
minutes before the hearing of the application.

# 130. Registration of service clerks for admiralty matters

(1) Pursuant to Order 70, Rule 7(3) and Rule 9(2) of the Rules of Court,
service of a writ or execution of a warrant of arrest may be effected by
a solicitor or a solicitor’s clerk whose name and particulars have been
notified to the Registrar.

(2) Solicitors' attention is drawn to paragraph 32(2) of these Practice
Directions which requires solicitors to notify the Legal Registry of the
Supreme Court of the particulars of authorised process servers, who have
been authorised by them to serve processes and execute warrants of
arrest by submitting a <span style="text-align: justify;">request to
authorise user through the Electronic Filing Service. Where such
authorised process servers are no longer so authorised, solicitors are
to revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by submitting a
request through the Electronic Filing Service. Solicitors’ clerks do not
require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of
processes and documents.</span>

(3) Paragraphs 32(3) to 32(6) of these Practice Directions shall,
mutatis mutandis, apply to the assignment of the Sheriff to effect
service of a writ or execute a warrant of arrest.

# 130A. Applications for appraisement and sale

(1) Any party applying for the appraisement and sale of any property in
an admiralty action shall include a prayer to the Court to appoint one
or more appraisers to value the property.  The applicant shall submit
with the application a list of appraisers maintained by the Sheriff.

(2) The Court appointed appraiser(s) must be named in Form 170 of
Appendix B to the Rules of Court.

(3) The list of appraisers referred to in sub-paragraph (1) may be found
on the Supreme Court website at http://www.supremecourt.gov.sg or will
be provided by the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court upon request.
