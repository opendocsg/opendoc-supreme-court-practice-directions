In particular: (1) The following definition of “working day” in Order 1, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court is applicable in these Practice Directions: “Working day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday. (2) The provisions of Order 3 of the Rules of Court shall also apply to the calculation of time: “Month” means calendar month (O. 3, r. 1) 1. Without prejudice to the Interpretation Act (Chapter 1), in its application to these Rules, the word “month”, where it occurs in any judgment, order, direction or other document forming part of any proceedings in Court, means a calendar month unless the context otherwise requires. Reckoning periods of time (O. 3, r. 2) 2. — (1) Any period of time fixed by these Rules or by any judgment, order or direction for doing any act shall be reckoned in accordance with this Rule. (2) Where the act is required to be done within a specified period after or from a specified date, the period begins immediately after that date. (3) Where the act is required to be done within or not less than a specified period before a specified date, the period ends immediately before that date. (4) Where the act is required to be done a specified number of clear days before or after a specified date, at least that number of days must intervene between the day on which the act is done and that date. (5) Where, apart from this paragraph, the period in question, being a period of 7 days or less, would include a day other than a working day, that day shall be excluded. Time expires on a day other than a working day (O. 3, r. 3) 3. Where the time prescribed by these Rules, or by any judgment, order or direction, for doing any act expires on a day other than a working day, the act shall be in time if done on the next working day. Extension, etc., of time (O. 3, r. 4) 4. —(1) The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, by order extend or abridge the period within which a person is required or authorised by these Rules or by any judgment, order or direction, to do any act in any proceedings. (2) The Court may extend any such period as is referred to in paragraph (1) although the application for extension is not made until after the expiration of that period. (3) The period within which a person is required by these Rules, or by any order or direction, to serve, file or amend any pleading or other document may be extended by consent (given in writing) without an order of the Court being made for that purpose, unless the Court specifies otherwise. (4) In this Rule, references to the Court shall be construed as including references to the Court of Appeal. (5) Paragraph (3) shall not apply to the period within which any action or matter is required to be set down for trial or hearing or within which any notice of appeal is required to be filed."

Urgent applications outside of the Court’s office hours (1) When an applicant files an application for any civil matter (including applications for interim injunctions or interim preservation of subject matter of proceedings, evidence and assets to satisfy judgments) or criminal matter, and the application is so urgent that it has to be attended to outside of the hours specified in paragraph 12(2) of these Practice Directions, the applicant’s counsel must contact the Registrar on duty at 6332 4351 or 6332 4352. (2) When the applicant seeks an urgent hearing for the application, all the papers required for the application must have been prepared, together with the appropriate draft orders of Court. Where the documents (including the originating process) have yet to be filed in Court when counsel seeks the urgent hearing, he must furnish an undertaking to the Registrar processing the application to have these documents filed in Court by such time as the Registrar may direct and, in any event, no later than the next working day. (3) In seeking an urgent hearing, counsel is to ensure that all applicable notice requirements prescribed by these Practice Directions are complied with. For criminal matters to be heard inter partes, notice must be given to the other party prior to the applicant seeking an urgent hearing. (4) The Registrar will only arrange for the matter to be heard outside of office hours if it is so urgent that it cannot be heard the next working day. The hearing may take place in the Registrar’s Chambers in the Supreme Court or at any place as directed by the Judge or Registrar hearing the matter. (5) If the application is of sufficient urgency, the Registrar may also direct counsel to send the application and supporting documents by email. The Judge or Registrar has the discretion to decide whether to deal with the application by email or to hear counsel personally."

(2) On Mondays to Fridays (excluding public holidays), the duty hours shall be from 9.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and from 2.30 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. (3) Only advocates and solicitors (or a litigant who is not legally represented) shall appear before the Duty Registrar. (4) Except where the attendance of the advocate and solicitor is required under sub-paragraph (6) below, the filing of the relevant documents will be sufficient for the Duty Registrar to dispose of any application or matter. Documents will be returned to the advocate and solicitor through the Electronic Filing Service to the inbox of the law firm’s computer system or through the service bureau. (5) All Court fees for the filing of documents should be duly paid before presentation of the documents to the Duty Registrar for his or her signature and/or decision. (6) The advocate and solicitor’s attendance is compulsory only: (a) when he or she is requesting an early or urgent date for a hearing before the Registrar or Judge; (b) when an application or document is returned with the direction “solicitor to attend”; or (c) when his or her attendance is required by any provision of law. (7) A solicitor may, if he or she wishes to expedite matters, attend before the Duty Registrar even if his or her attendance is not ordinarily required. (8) A solicitor or a litigant who is not legally represented (collectively, “parties”) who wishes to attend before a Duty Registrar and to refer him or her to documents filed must either: (a) file the documents at least one hour before attending before the Duty Registrar, so that the documents would already be in the electronic case file for the Duty Registrar’s reference. Parties should as far as possible only attend before the Duty Registrar after they have received notification from the Court that the documents have been accepted. Parties should also check with the Registry that the documents have been routed to the Duty Registrar before attending before the Duty Registrar; or (b) attend before the Duty Registrar with the hard copy documents. The Duty Registrar will require the relevant party to give an undertaking to file all the documents by the next working day before dealing with the matter. (9) A solicitor or a litigant who is not legally represented (collectively, “parties”) who wishes to attend before a Duty Registrar by way of video conferencing must call the Case Management Officer (“CMO”) to notify the Court of the following: (a) when the application and all related documents were filed; (b) the case number; (c) if there is no case number assigned, the name(s) of the parties and names of the counsel and law firm(s) acting for such parties; (d) whether any natural person or business corporate entity involved in the case is unrepresented, and if so, the name of that person or entity; (e) explain briefly the nature of the application and directions sought from the Duty Registrar; (f) the time and date that he or she wishes to attend before the Duty Registrar; (g) whether he or she wishes to send in any documents via the Electronic Filing Service ahead of the hearing or during the hearing before the Duty Registrar; (h) whether he or she wishes to tender any hard copy documents ahead of the hearing before the Duty Registrar; (i) the name(s) of all the parties who will be attending the hearing before the Duty Registrar, and the email address and telephone number of these parties. If parties wish to tender any hard copy documents ahead of the hearing before the Duty Registrar, parties should as far as possible provide the hard copies and ensure that they have been placed before the Duty Registrar at least 1 hour before the scheduled hearing. Parties should check with the CMO that the documents have been placed before the Duty Registrar before the scheduled hearing."

Request for urgent hearing before Judge (1) Before an applicant attends before the Duty Registrar to request an urgent hearing before a Judge of any application for any civil matter, the applicant should complete (as far as possible) and file Form 1A of Appendix A of these Practice Directions. A copy of Form 1A should be served on each respondent to the application at the time of filing, unless the application is an ex parte application and service of Form 1A would or might defeat the purpose of the application. (2) The applicant should prepare skeletal submissions for the urgent hearing before the Judge, and file the skeletal submissions at the same time as Form 1A. A copy of the skeletal submissions should be served on each respondent to the application at the time of filing, unless the application is an ex parte application and service of the skeletal submissions would or might defeat the purpose of the application. If the skeletal submissions are not filed, the applicant should inform the Duty Registrar whether the skeletal submissions will be filed and served by the time of the urgent hearing before the Judge. (3) If, due to urgency, the applicant is unable to file or serve Form 1A and/or the skeletal submissions before attending before the Duty Registrar, the applicant should provide a copy each of Form 1A and the skeletal submissions to each respondent to the application when the parties attend before the Duty Registrar. Each such copy of Form 1A or the skeletal submissions must be a hard copy, if the parties attend before the Duty Registrar physically, or in soft copy, if the parties attend before the Duty Registrar by live video or live television link. Thereafter, Form 1A and the skeletal submissions should be filed as soon as possible and, in any event, no later than the next working day after the attendance before the Duty Registrar, unless the Court directs otherwise. If any respondent does not attend before the Duty Registrar, Form 1A and the skeletal submissions should be served on that respondent as soon as possible after the hearing before the Duty Registrar, and, in any event, before the urgent hearing before the Judge, unless the Court directs otherwise. (4) In cases of extreme urgency where the applicant is unable to comply with the requirement to file or provide a copy of the skeletal submissions by the time of the urgent hearing before the Judge, the applicant should inform the Duty Registrar of the applicant’s intention to seek a dispensation of that requirement at the hearing before the Judge, and provide supporting reasons for the dispensation. (5) The applicant’s skeletal submissions should contain the following: (a) the relevant facts; (b) the applicable law; (c) the reason(s) for requesting an urgent hearing; and (d) a summary of arguments. (6) The applicant’s skeletal submissions should be in the following format: (a) all pages should be paginated; (b) the skeletal submissions should not exceed 10 pages (excluding the cover page and backing page); (c) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent; (d) the print of every page must be double-spaced; and (e) every page must have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35mm in width."

(2) However, where an adjournment of the hearing date of any cause or matter is sought, solicitors for all parties must attend the hearing. See also paragraphs 67 and 68 of these Practice Directions.

(2) However, subject to any written law, the Court may, in its discretion, permit interested parties, such as instructing solicitors, foreign legal counsel and parties to the matter, to attend hearings in chambers. In exercising its discretion, the Court may consider a broad range of factors including: (a) the interest that the person seeking permission has in the matter before the Court; (b) the interests of the litigants; (c) the reasons for which such permission is sought; and (d) the Court’s interest in preserving and upholding its authority and dignity."

The medical certificate must be in the proper form and contain the information and particulars required by sub-paragraphs (2) to (5). (2) A medical certificate issued by a Government hospital or clinic may be in the pre-printed form produced by the Ministry of Health, a sample of which may be found at Form 1 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions. A medical certificate issued by a restructured hospital or specialist centre may also be in a pre-printed form similar to the sample which appears at Form 1. The pre-printed medical certificate must: (a) be completely and properly filled in; (b) contain the name of the medical practitioner who issued the medical certificate; (c) state the name of the hospital or clinic in which the medical practitioner practises; (d) indicate that the person to whom the certificate is issued is unfit to attend Court, and specify the date(s) on which he is unfit to attend Court; (e) be signed in full by the medical practitioner (and not merely initialled); and (f) be authenticated by a rubber stamp showing the medical practitioner’s full name and his designation in the hospital or clinic, as the case may be. (3) If a medical certificate is not in Form 1, the medical certificate should: (a) be addressed to “Registrar, Supreme Court” (and not “whoever-it-may-concern”); (b) identify clearly the medical practitioner who issued the certificate; (c) state the name of the hospital or clinic at which it was issued; (d) be signed in full by the medical practitioner (and not merely initialled); (e) be authenticated by a rubber stamp showing the medical practitioner’s full name and designation; (f) contain a diagnosis of the patient concerned (unless the diagnosis cannot or should not normally be disclosed); (g) contain a statement to the effect that the person to whom the certificate is issued is medically unfit to attend Court, and specify the date(s) on which the person is unfit to attend Court; and (h) bear the date on which it was written and, where this differs from the date of consultation, this must be clearly disclosed. (4) If any portion of the information set out in sub-paragraph (3) is not found in the medical certificate itself, such information may be included in a memorandum which should be attached to the medical certificate. This memorandum must: (a) identify clearly the medical practitioner who issued the memorandum; (b) contain the name of the hospital or clinic at which it was issued; (c) be signed in full by the medical practitioner (and not merely initialled); and (d) be authenticated by a rubber stamp showing the medical practitioner’s full name and designation. (5) All information and details in any medical certificate or memorandum must be clearly and legibly printed. (6) If the directions set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) are not complied with, the Court may reject the medical certificate and decline to excuse the attendance of the person to whom the medical certificate was issued. The Court may then take any action it deems appropriate. (7) This paragraph shall apply to all hearings in the Supreme Court, whether in open Court or in Chambers. (8) This paragraph shall apply to both civil and criminal proceedings."

(2) Before taking a CDMS queue number, solicitors are to have conferred with their opponent(s) and enter the estimated duration of their own submissions. The number of minutes entered should be an accurate reflection of the actual duration of submissions expected to be made by each of the solicitors. Solicitors should indicate in the CDMS that they are ready for hearing only when the solicitors for all the parties concerned are present.

"text": "19. Submissions and examination by leading and assisting counsel (1) In the event that a party is represented by more than one counsel at a hearing, whether in open Court or in Chambers, the making of submissions and the questioning of witnesses may be carried out by one counsel for each party only. (2) If a party would like certain portions of the submissions, or examination, cross-examination or re-examination of witnesses to be conducted by different counsel in the same case, an oral application should be made to Court as early as is practicable and by no later than the commencement of the trial or hearing for leave to do so. The following information should be provided to the Court for the purposes of the application: (a) the issues on which each counsel will be making submissions; and/or (b) the witnesses to be examined, cross-examined or re-examined by each counsel, or the portions of their evidence for which each counsel will conduct the examination, cross-examination or re-examination. Nothing in this paragraph detracts from the responsibility of lead counsel to ensure that all counsel making submissions, or having conduct of any portion of the examination, cross-examination or re-examination of witnesses, are adequately supervised and able to handle the tasks assigned to them. (3) If leave has been granted in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), counsel should ensure that he or she confines himself or herself to the issues or portions of evidence in respect of which leave was granted and that there is no overlap in the issues or the examination being dealt with by different counsel for the same party. Further, counsel must not repeat, clarify or expand on any submissions that have been made by another counsel for the same party, or examine, cross-examine or re-examine witnesses on portions of their evidence dealt with by another counsel for the same party. (4) If leave of the Court is not sought in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), only one counsel will be allowed to make submissions or conduct examination, cross-examination or re-examination for a party throughout the hearing. (5) For civil proceedings, lead counsel are strongly encouraged to apprise the client of the benefits of allocating certain advocacy tasks to junior assisting counsel, including the potential benefits of reduced legal costs and increased focus by lead counsel on the main advocacy tasks, and to therefore consider obtaining instructions to make an application in accordance with sub-paragraph (2). In this regard, lead counsel are encouraged to consider that giving junior assisting counsel more opportunities for oral advocacy could potentially benefit the client and, at the same time, promote renewal of the Bar. (6) For civil trials: (a) Notwithstanding sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), and save where lead counsel is a junior counsel, the junior assisting counsel shall deliver the oral opening statement unless the Court otherwise orders; and (b) lead counsel are to inform the trial judge at the Judge Pre-Trial Conference (“JPTC”), or if a JPTC has not been fixed, at the start of the trial, whether their client will be making an application pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) above and, if so, the proposed division of advocacy tasks between lead counsel and junior assisting counsel. (7) Unless stated otherwise, this paragraph shall apply to both civil and criminal proceedings."

(10) Requests for translation of documents in Chinese, Malay or Tamil for use in Supreme Court proceedings must be filed through the Electronic Filing Service at least 4 weeks before the date the translations are required. Failure to comply with the directions set out in this sub-paragraph may result in the translations not being available or provided by the date they are required. (11) In the event that the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section is unable to accept a translation request, parties and counsel should approach a private translation service instead. (12) Litigants who are not legally represented may submit their requests for interpretation services or translation of documents for Supreme Court proceedings using the respective forms available on the Singapore Courts website at https://www.judiciary.gov.sg."

"text": "24. Access to case file, inspection, taking copies and searches Access by parties to a case file (1) All parties to a case who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service may, subject to this paragraph and any directions of the Court, access the online case file made available through the Electronic Filing Service and may inspect, download soft copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file. (2) Where a party to a case is not a registered user and is unable to access the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, the procedure governing file inspection by non-parties to a case in sub-paragraph (5) below shall be followed. (3) All parties to a case shall have the liberty to make amendments at will to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service. Administrative details include the contact details of solicitors, the identities of the solicitors, and the nature of the claim. Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, he or she may attend at the service bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file. (4) The Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is approved. For example, amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court; and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof. File inspection by non-parties or parties who are not registered users (5) In order to inspect a case file, the following procedure should be followed: (a) A Request should be made to obtain leave to inspect the file. The Request should state the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection. If this person is not a solicitor, his or her identification and contact details should also be included in the Request, and his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) should be produced for verification when requested. The Request should also state the interest that the applicant has in the matter, and the reason for the search or inspection. If the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, the Request should clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter. (b) Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court, (i) registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service; (ii) parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the service bureau. After verifying the approval, the service bureau will assign the inspecting party a personal computer for the inspection to be carried out. An inspecting party will usually be allowed 60 minutes to carry out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the service bureau may impose a charge for use of the computer. The service bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected. (6) Solicitors must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of their clerks who have their authority to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period. (7) For the avoidance of doubt, a non-party that has obtained approval to inspect a case file may take and retain a soft copy of any document that is available for inspection. All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the Request to inspect. Solicitors shall be responsible for informing their clients of this. Obtaining certified true copies of documents (7A) Users are encouraged to use the Authentic Court Order system to validate orders of court issued after 2 January 2020 by going to https://www.courtorders.gov.sg. However, certified true copies of orders of court will still be available upon application. (8) Applications to obtain certified true paper copies of documents should be made by way of filing a Request through the Electronic Filing Service. (a) The intended use of the certified true copies should be clearly stated in the Request. The relevance and necessity of the certified true copies in relation to their intended use should also be clearly described. (b) The applicant will be informed of the outcome to his or her Request and the fees payable for the provision of the certified true copies if the Request is approved. Upon confirmation of the receipt of payment of the fees payable, the certified true copies will be released to the applicant. The Registry may require verification of the identity of the applicant against his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) prior to release of the certified true copies. (c) The fees prescribed by Appendix B to the Rules of Court will be payable for the provision of the above service. Electronic cause books and registers maintained by the Registry (9) Order 60 of the Rules of Court provides that the Registry shall maintain information prescribed or required to be kept by the Rules of Court and Practice Directions issued by the Registrar. In addition to any provisions in the Rules of Court, the Registrar hereby directs that the following information shall be maintained by the Registry: (a) details of all originating processes, including: (i) details of interlocutory applications; (ii) details of appeals filed therein; (iii) details of admiralty proceedings; (iv) details of caveats filed against arrest of vessels; (v) details of probate proceedings, including wills and caveats filed therein; (vi) details of bankruptcy proceedings; and (vii) details of winding up proceedings against companies and limited liability partnerships; (b) details of writs of execution, writs of distress and warrants of arrest; (c) details of appeals ﬁled in the Court of Appeal and appeals filed in the Appellate Division; and (d) any other information as may from time to time be found necessary. (10) Searches of this information under Order 60, Rule 3 may be conducted through the Electronic Filing Service at a service bureau or at the Legal Registry. The fees prescribed by Appendix B to the Rules of Court will be payable for such searches. (11) An application may be made by any person for a licence to use any information contained in any electronic cause book or register subject to such terms and conditions as the Registrar may determine. Successful applicants will be required to enter into separate technical services agreements with the Electronic Filing Service provider. Applications under this sub-paragraph must be made in writing, identifying the data fields sought and providing details of how the information will be used."

Authorisation for collection of mail and Court documents (1) Without prejudice to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), all law firms are required to notify the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court of the particulars of person(s) authorised to collect Court documents or mail from the Supreme Court on their behalf by submitting a request to authorise user through the Electronic Filing Service. (2) Where such authorised persons are no longer so authorised, law firms are required to revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by submitting a request through the Electronic Filing Service. Until receipt of such notification of revocation or deletion, Court documents and mail shall continue to be released to such authorised persons upon production of evidence of identification. (3) Any solicitor may collect Court documents and mail on behalf of his firm and any litigant who is not legally represented may collect documents and mail intended for him in any matter in which he is a party. (4) A law firm may authorise a courier service-provider to collect Court documents or mail from the Supreme Court on their behalf. At the time of collection, the courier service-provider should produce a letter of authorisation which is printed on the law firm’s letterhead and addressed to the courier service-provider. The said letter of authorisation should clearly state the case number, the name of the courier service-provider appointed to collect and the Court documents or mail to be collected. An employee or representative of the courier service-provider collecting the Court documents or mail may be requested to provide evidence that will allow the Supreme Court to verify that he is an employee or representative from the courier service-provider and will have to acknowledge receipt of the Court documents or mail collected."

Electronic payment of Court fees Implementation of the electronic system for the payment of Court fees (1) Subject to these Practice Directions, all Court fees not paid using the Electronic Filing Service must be paid by electronic means. Modes of payment by electronic means (2) Payment by electronic means includes payment effected by Interbank GIRO (IBG), NETS and selected credit cards. For law firms with standing GIRO arrangements with the Supreme Court, payment by IBG would be the most appropriate mode of electronic payment where Court fees are paid over the counter. A law firm using IBG for such purposes will authorise the Supreme Court to deduct the fees from its bank account upon lodgement of the prescribed form. Scope of payment by electronic means (3) The electronic means of payment cover all Court fees previously collected over-the-counter and hearing fees in the Supreme Court. Registrar’s discretion (4) Unless otherwise approved by the Registrar, payment of Court fees collected over-the-counter must be made by electronic means. The Registrar may, in any case, waive the requirement for the payment to be effected by electronic means, on such terms and conditions as he or she deems fit."

Identification numbers to be stated in cause papers Parties named in the title of the documents (1) Where a party to any proceedings in the Supreme Court first files a document in such proceedings, he or she shall provide his or her identification number in accordance with the Electronic Filing System data entry fields for identification number. Parties not named in the title of the documents (2) Where a party to any proceedings in the Supreme Court first files a document in such proceedings, and the name of the party does not appear in the title of the document but does appear in the body of the document, the identification number of the party should be provided in accordance with the Electronic Filing System data entry fields for identification number. Documents filed by 2 or more parties (3) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to documents which are filed by more than one party. Identification numbers for non-parties (4) If any person (living or dead), any entity or any property is the subject matter of any proceedings, or is affected by any proceedings, but is not a party thereto, and the name of such person, entity or property is to appear in the title of the documents filed in the proceedings, the party filing the first document in the proceedings must provide the identification number of such person, entity or property in accordance with the Electronic Filing System data entry fields for identification number. If the party filing the first document in the proceedings is unable, after reasonable enquiry, to discover the identification number of the person, entity or property, he or she may state “(ID No. not known)”. Special cases (5) The following directions shall apply in addition to the directions contained in sub-paragraphs (1) to (4): (a) where a party is represented by a litigation representative or guardian in adoption, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the litigation representative or guardian in adoption as if he or she was a party to the proceedings, and the identification numbers of the party, the litigation representative and/or the guardian in adoption must be provided in accordance with the Electronic Filing System data entry fields for identification number; (b) where parties are involved in any proceedings as the personal representatives of the estate of a deceased person, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the deceased person as if he were a party; (c) where more than one identification number applies to any party, person, entity or property, the identification numbers shall be stated in any convenient order; and (d) for bankruptcy matters, the creditor must, in addition to his or her own identification number, also provide the identification number of the debtor in the first document filed by the creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings. Identification numbers (6) When entering the identification number in the Electronic Filing Service, the full identification number, including the letters before and after the number should be entered. Guidelines for the selection of identification numbers (7) The following guidelines should be followed in deciding on the appropriate identification number: NATURAL PERSON WITH SINGAPORE IDENTITY CARD (a) For a natural person who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, the identification number shall be the number of the identity card issued under the National Registration Act 1965. The 7 digit number as well as the letters at the front and end should be stated. For example, “(NRIC No. S1234567A)”. NATURAL PERSON WITH FIN NUMBER (b) For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act 1965, but has been assigned a FIN number under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Regulation 1), the identification number shall be the FIN number. The number should be preceded by the prefix “FIN No.” NATURAL PERSON: BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR PASSPORT NUMBER (c) For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act 1965 or assigned an FIN number, the identification number shall be the birth certificate or passport number. The number should be preceded by either of the following, as appropriate: “(Issuing country) BC No.” or “(Issuing country) PP No.” NATURAL PERSON: OTHER NUMBERS (d) For a natural person who is not a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and has not been assigned an FIN number and does not have a birth certificate or passport number, the identification number shall be the number of any identification document he may possess. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority issuing the identification document to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Japanese Identification Card No.” DECEASED PERSON (e) For a deceased natural person, the identification number shall be as set out in sub-paragraph 7(a) to (d) above. However, if such numbers are not available, the identification number shall be the death registration number under the Registration of Births and Deaths Regulations 2022 or the equivalent foreign provisions, where the death is registered abroad. The number as well as the following words should be stated: “(Country or place of registration of death) Death Reg. No.” COMPANY REGISTERED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT 1967 (f) For a company registered under the Companies Act 1967, the identification number shall be the Unique Entity Number (UEN). COMPANY REGISTERED OUTSIDE SINGAPORE (g) For a company registered outside Singapore which is not registered under the Companies Act 1967, the identification number shall be the registration number of the company in the country of registration. BUSINESS REGISTERED UNDER THE BUSINESS NAMES REGISTRATION ACT 2014 (h) For a body registered under the Business Names Registration Act 2014, the identification number shall be the UEN number. LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP REGISTERED UNDER THE LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIPS ACT 2005 (i) For a limited liability partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005, the identification number shall be the UEN number. OTHER BODIES AND ASSOCIATIONS (j) For any other body or association, whether incorporated or otherwise, which does not fall within sub-paragraph 7(f) to (i) above, the identification number shall be any unique number assigned to the body or association by any authority. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority assigning the number to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Singapore Trade Union Reg. No. 123 A”. SHIP OR VESSEL (k) For a ship or vessel, the identification number shall be the registration number assigned by the port of registry. If no such registration number is available, the identification number assigned by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) or the number of the license granted by any authority shall be the identification number. NO IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS EXIST (l) Where the appropriate identification numbers prescribed by sub-paragraph (7)(a) to (k) above do not exist, the following words should be stated immediately below or after the name of the party, person, entity or property concerned: “(No ID No. exists)”. Inability to furnish identification number at the time of filing a document (8) If a party who wishes to file a document is unable at the time of filing to furnish the necessary identification numbers required by this paragraph, the party may indicate “(ID No. Not Known)” at the time of filing. However, when the necessary identification numbers have been obtained, the party will have to furnish the necessary identification numbers to the Registry through the Electronic Filing Service. Meaning of document (9) For the avoidance of doubt, the words “document” and “documents” when used in this paragraph include all originating processes filed in the Supreme Court regardless of whether they are governed by the Rules of Court. The words also include all documents filed in connection with bankruptcy proceedings. Non-compliance (10) Any document which does not comply with this paragraph may be rejected for filing by the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court."

"text": "32. Personal service of processes and documents (1) The attention of solicitors is drawn to Order 62, Rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court, which provides: “Personal service must be effected by a process server of the Supreme Court or by a solicitor or a solicitor’s clerk whose name and particulars have been notified to the Registrar for this purpose: Provided that the Registrar may, in a particular cause or matter, allow personal service to be effected by any other named person and shall, in that case, cause to be marked on the document required to be served personally, a memorandum to that effect.” [emphasis added.] (2) Solicitors are required to notify the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court of the particulars of such clerks who have been authorised by them to serve processes and documents (“authorised process servers”) by submitting a request to authorise user through the Electronic Filing Service. Where such authorised process servers are no longer so authorised, solicitors are to revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by submitting a request through the Electronic Filing Service. Solicitors’ clerks do not require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of processes and documents. (3) As personal service can be effected by a solicitor or a solicitor’s clerk, Court process servers will not be assigned to effect personal service of processes and documents unless there are special reasons. (4) If there are special reasons requiring personal service by a Court process server, a Request for such service should be filed through the Electronic Filing Service, setting out the special reasons. The approval of the Duty Registrar should then be obtained for such service. Once approval has been obtained, a process server will be assigned to effect service and an appointment for service convenient to both the litigant and the assigned process server will be given. (5) On the appointed date, the person accompanying the process server should call at the Legal Registry. The amount required for the transport charges of the process server (a record of which will be kept) should be tendered. Alternatively, the Legal Registry should be informed beforehand that transport for the process server will be provided. The Legal Registry will then instruct the process server to effect service. (6) Under no circumstances should any payment be made directly to the process server."

Substituted service (1) In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the proposed mode of substituted service will probably be effectual in bringing the document in question to the notice of the person to be served. (2) Two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an order for substituted service is filed. In an application for substituted service, the applicant shall demonstrate by way of affidavit why he or she believes that the attempts at service made were reasonable. (3) The applicant should, where appropriate, also consider other modes of substituted service, such as AR registered post or electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission) in addition to or in substitution of substituted service by posting on doors or gates of residential and business premises. (4) An application for substituted service by posting at an address or by AR registered post should contain evidence (for example, relevant search results from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Singapore Land Authority, the Housing &amp; Development Board or the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) that the person to be served is resident or can be located at the property. (5) For the avoidance of doubt, substituted service by AR registered post is deemed to be effected when the postal service has delivered the document, or attempted to deliver the document (in cases where no one is present or willing to accept the document). (6) If substituted service is by electronic mail, it has to be shown that the electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that it is currently active. (7) An application for substituted service by advertisement (in one issue of the Straits Times if the person to be served is literate in English, or one issue of the Straits Times and one issue of one of the main non-English language newspapers where his language literacy is unknown) should only be considered as a last resort and should contain evidence that the person to be served is literate in the language of the newspaper in which the advertisement will be placed."

Such endorsements on originating processes and other documents do not require the Registrar’s signature as they are made pursuant to either an order of Court or the Rules of Court. The Registrar should therefore not be asked to sign such endorsements. (3) For documents that are filed through the Electronic Filing Service as electronic forms composed online: (a) Solicitors should select the appropriate endorsement, and check the accuracy of the electronic form in the preview stage before filing the originating process or other document. The acceptance by the Registry of electronic forms composed online does not affect the regularity of any endorsements on the document. (b) Where endorsements can be made prior to the filing or issuance of a document, those endorsements shall be incorporated into the document before the document is filed or issued. (c) Where endorsements must be made on a document which has already been filed or issued, a fresh copy of the document containing the relevant endorsements shall be prepared, and the document must be re-filed or re-issued, as the case may be.

Amendment of any document (2) Where a document is required to be amended and filed in Court, a fresh copy of the document with the amendments included must be prepared, regardless of the number and length of the amendments sought to be made. (3) The procedure for amending a document is as follows: (a) A fresh amended copy of the document should be produced. (b) The number of times the document has been amended shall be indicated in parentheses after the name of the document. It should therefore be entitled “[document name] (Amendment No. 1)” or “[document name] (Amendment No. 2)”, or as appropriate. (c) The changes made in the document from the latest version of the document filed in Court should be indicated in the following way: (i) deletions shall be made by drawing a single line across the words to be deleted; and (ii) insertions shall be underlined. (4) The directions in sub-paragraph (3)(b) shall not apply to originating summonses and summonses amended from an inter partes application to an ex parte application or vice versa.

Amendment of pleadings (6) The directions in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) shall apply to the amendment of pleadings. A Statement of Claim which is amended for the first time should be filed as “Statement of Claim” (Amendment No. 1)”, and a Defence that is amended for the second time should be filed as “Defence (Amendment No. 2)”.

AMENDMENT FOR THIRD TIME OR MORE (8) From the third round of amendments onwards, the amended pleading should comprise two versions of the document: (a) a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by (b) a version showing the amendments in colour. Only one amended pleading consisting of these two versions is required to be filed. Amendment endorsements on electronic forms (9) Order 20, Rule 10(2) of the Rules of Court requires that an amended pleading or other document be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, and if no such order was made, the number of the Rule in Order 20 in pursuance of which the amendment was made. Where electronic forms are amended, the amendment endorsement shall take either one of the following forms: (a) By order of court made on [date order was made]; or (b) Pursuant to Order 20, Rule [cite specific rule number]. (10) The amendment endorsement shall be appended to the title of the electronic form, after the amendment number as required under sub-paragraph (3)(b) above. Where an electronic form is amended more than once, the endorsement need only cite the basis for the most recent amendment. For example, Originating Summons (Amendment No 3, by order of court made on 1 January 2013) Writ of Summons (Amendment No 1, pursuant to O 20, r 3) (11) The date of the electronic form shall reflect the date on which the document is amended."

(3) The guidelines in Appendix I to these Practice Directions on advising clients about ADR shall apply.

This is especially where ADR may save costs, achieve a quicker resolution and a surer way of meeting their client’s needs. (5) The attention of advocates and solicitors as well as all parties is drawn to Order 59, Rule 5(c) of the Rules of Court, which provides that: The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account — … the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution … Advocates and solicitors should advise their clients on potential adverse costs orders for any unreasonable refusal to engage in ADR."

(4) If all the parties are willing to attempt ADR, directions may be given by the court in relation to the relevant civil case, including an adjournment of pending proceedings in court with stipulated timelines for the completion of the ADR process. (5) In exercising its discretion as to costs, including costs of any claim or issue in any proceedings or of the entire action, the court may consider all the relevant circumstances of the case, including the ADR Offer and the Response to ADR Offer."

Filing of summonses All interlocutory applications to be made by summons (1) The former Form 10 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court (Notice of Motion) has been deleted with effect from 1 January 2006.

Any summons that is not so endorsed will be regarded as a contentious matter liable to exceed a hearing duration of 10 minutes. (3) After the filing of any “ex parte” or “by consent” summons, the application will be examined by the Judge or Registrar as the case may be. If he is satisfied that the application is in order and all other requirements have been complied with, he may make the order(s) applied for on the day fixed for the hearing of the application without the attendance of the applicant or his solicitor.

"text": "37A. Filing of Distinct Applications in Separate Summonses (1) Where a party intends to make more than one distinct substantive application in a cause or matter, he must file each application in a separate summons. Distinct applications should not be combined in a single summons, unless they are inextricably or closely linked, or involve overlapping or substantially similar issues. For example, it can be envisaged that applications for: (a) extension or abridgment of time; (b) amendment of pleadings, summons, etc.; and (c) costs may be closely linked to other more substantive applications. (2) In addition, applications should not contain alternative prayers when the alternative prayers sought in effect amount to distinct applications. For example, a party should not make an application for further and better particulars on particular issues, and in the alternative, interrogatories on different issues. In such a case, separate summonses should be filed. In contrast, the following is an example of alternative prayer which may be permitted: In the defendant’s summons setting out a prayer for the striking out of certain paragraphs of the Statement of Claim, the defendant may include an alternative prayer for the plaintiff to be ordered to amend those paragraphs of the Statement of Claim. (3) Any summons that is not in compliance with this paragraph may be rejected by the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court. The Court may also direct the party to file separate summonses before proceeding with the hearing or proceed with the hearing on the solicitor’s undertaking to file further summonses for the distinct applications."

(3) Unless otherwise directed by the Court, the parties must complete the Summary Table in the following manner: (a) The applicant must complete Columns A and B of the Summary Table, and serve the Summary Table on the respondent, when filing the application. The applicant may also complete Column C of the Summary Table before the applicant serves the Summary Table on the respondent under this sub-paragraph.

(2) Subject to subsection (3), the General Division of the High Court may, if it thinks ﬁt, and on such terms as it sees ﬁt, and either on its own motion or on application, order that the proceedings be transferred accordingly notwithstanding any other provision of this Act. (3) An order under subsection (2) may only be made in respect of such proceedings as could have been commenced in the State Court to which the application relates, if the value of the claim had been within the District Court limit or the Magistrate’s Court limit, as the case may be. Explanation — The fact that the proceedings fall within the civil jurisdiction of the State Courts would not, by itself, ordinarily constitute suﬃcient reason for transferring the proceedings to the State Courts, if enforcement overseas is intended of any judgment obtained in the General Division of the High Court under any enforcement arrangements currently in force."

"text": "41. Ex parte applications for injunctions (1) Order 29, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court provides that an application for the grant of an injunction may be made ex parte in cases of urgency. However, the cases of Castle Fitness Consultancy Pte Ltd v Manz [1989] SLR 896 and The ‘Nagasaki Spirit’ (No 1) [1994] 1 SLR 434 take the position that an opponent to an ex parte application, especially where the application seeks injunctive relief, should be invited to attend at the hearing of the application. (2) In view of this, any party applying ex parte for an injunction (including a Mareva injunction) must give notice of the application to the other concerned parties prior to the hearing. The notice may be given by way of facsimile transmission or telex, or, in cases of extreme urgency, orally by telephone. Except in cases of extreme urgency or with the leave of the Court, the party shall give a minimum of two hours’ notice to the other parties before the hearing. The notice should inform the other parties of the date, time and place fixed for the hearing of the application and the nature of the relief sought. If possible, a copy of the originating process, the ex parte summons and supporting affidavit(s) should be given to each of the other parties in draft form as soon as they are ready to be filed in Court. At the hearing of the ex parte application, in the event that some or all of the other parties are not present or represented, the applicant’s solicitors should inform the Court of: (a) the attempts that were made to notify the other parties or their solicitors of the making of the application; and (b) what documents were given to the other parties or their solicitors and when these documents were given; and (c) whether the other parties or their solicitors consent to the application being heard without their presence. (3) The directions set out in sub-paragraph (2) need not be followed if the giving of the notice to the other parties, or some of them, would or might defeat the purpose of the ex parte application. However, in such cases, the reasons for not following the directions should be clearly set out in the affidavit prepared in support of the ex parte application."

Mareva injunctions and search orders (1) Pursuant to Order 32, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, the Honourable the Chief Justice has directed that applications for Mareva injunctions and for search orders, whether made on an ex parte or inter partes basis, should be heard by a Judge in person. For the avoidance of doubt, all other ex parte applications for interim injunctions may be heard by a Registrar. (2) Applicants for Mareva injunctions and search orders are required to prepare their orders in accordance with the following forms in Appendix A of these Practice Directions: (a) Form 6: Search order; (b) Form 7: worldwide Mareva injunction; and (c) Form 8: Mareva injunction limited to assets within the jurisdiction. When composing the summons electronic form online through the Electronic Filing Service, these Forms shall be prepared in Portable Document Format (PDF) and attached to the summons electronic form. (3) The language and layout of the forms are intended to make it easier for persons served with these orders to understand what they mean. These forms of orders should be used save to the extent that the Judge hearing a particular application considers there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from the terms of the prescribed forms should be justified by the applicant in his supporting affidavit(s). (4) The applicant should undertake not to inform any third party of the proceedings until after the return date. (5) Wherever practicable, applications should be made sufficiently early so as to ensure that the Judge has sufficient time to read and consider the application in advance. (6) On an ex parte application for either a Mareva injunction or a search order, an applicant may be required, in an appropriate case, to support his cross-undertaking in damages by a payment to be made into Court, a bond to be issued by an insurance company with a place of business within Singapore, a written guarantee to be issued from a bank with a place of business within Singapore or a payment to the applicant’s solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an officer of the Court pending further order. Applications for search orders (7) It was suggested in Universal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben [1992] 1 WLR 840 at 861 that the order be served by a supervising solicitor and carried out in his presence and under his supervision. (a) The supervising solicitor should be an experienced solicitor who is not a member or employee of the firm acting for the applicant and who has some familiarity with the operation of search orders. The evidence in support of the application should include the identity and experience of the proposed supervising solicitor. These guidelines are equally applicable in the local context and the Judge in his discretion may, in appropriate cases, require a supervising solicitor. (b) Where the premises are likely to be occupied by an unaccompanied woman, at least one of the persons attending on the service of the order should be a woman. (c) Where the nature of the items removed under the order makes this appropriate, the applicant will be required to insure them."

"text": "44. Introduction (1) This Part provides a framework for proportionate and economical discovery, inspection and supply of electronic copies of electronically stored documents. This Part or any portion thereof applies (a) by mutual agreement of all the parties in the cause or matter or (b) when the Court so orders, either on its own motion or on application by a party. A party that seeks to rely on this Part must cite the relevant paragraph(s) in any request or application made hereunder. (2) Parties should consider the application of this Part or any portion thereof in the following cases: (a) where the claim or the counterclaim exceeds $ 1 million; (b) where documents discoverable by a party exceeds 2,000 pages in aggregate; or (c) where documents discoverable in the case or matter comprise substantially of electronic mail and/or electronic documents. (3 ) For the avoidance of doubt, this Part applies to pre-action discovery, discovery between parties in a pending cause or matter, and third-party discovery. Location of electronically stored documents (4) Electronically stored documents may reside in storage management systems, folders or directories in storage locations, electronic media or recording devices, including folders or directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example, the Recycle Bin folder or Trash folder). Electronically stored documents or parts thereof may also reside in the unallocated file space or file slack on an electronic medium or recording device as deleted files or file fragments which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques. Meaning of “metadata information” (5) Metadata information refers to the non-visible and not readily apparent information embedded in or associated with electronically stored documents and may include both application metadata, which is created by the application software used to create the electronic documents, and system metadata, which is created by the operating or storage system. Examples of application metadata include hidden columns or text, formatting and display codes, formulae, prior edits and editorial comments; examples of system metadata include data relating to creation, modification and access of the electronic document, its size, file format and storage location, and other document profile information like title, author, subject and keywords or tags. Metadata information may be stored internally within the electronically stored document or externally in a separate file or database. Externally stored metadata information shall be discoverable as separate documents. Meaning of “not reasonably accessible documents” (6) Electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible include: (a) deleted files or file fragments containing information which may be recovered only through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques; and (b) documents archived using backup software and stored off-line on backup tapes or other storage media. Meaning of “forensic inspection” (7) A forensic inspection of an electronic medium or recording device means a reasonable search of the electronic medium or recording device for the purpose of recovering deleted electronic documents, which may extend to a forensic examination of the unallocated file space or file slack of the electronic medium or recording device using computer forensic tools and/or techniques."

Electronic discovery plans during general discovery (1) Within two weeks after the close of pleadings, parties are encouraged to collaborate in good faith and agree on issues relating to the discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents. Such issues may include the scope and/or any limits on documents to be given in discovery, whether parties are prepared to make voluntary disclosures, whether specific documents or class of documents ought to be specifically preserved, search terms to be used in reasonable searches, whether preliminary searches and/or data sampling are to be conducted and the giving of discovery in stages according to an agreed schedule, as well as the format and manner in which copies of discoverable documents shall be supplied. Parties are encouraged to have regard to the list of issues at Appendix E Part 1 (Check list of issues for good faith collaboration) in their discussions. Parties should exchange their checklists prior to commencing good faith discussions. (2) An electronic discovery plan may take the form set forth in Appendix E Part 2. Parties may include the agreed electronic discovery plan in the summons for directions. The Court shall consider the adequacy of the agreed electronic discovery plan and may make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter. The agreed electronic discovery plan, as amended by such order or direction of the Court as the case may be, shall form part of the order under the summons for directions to be extracted for the action. (3) If parties are unable to agree on an electronic discovery plan, the party seeking discovery of electronically stored documents under this Part may make an application to court. The application must include a draft electronic discovery plan and must be supported by affidavit providing an account of the attempts made by parties to collaborate in good faith to agree on an electronic discovery plan."

Reasonable searches for electronically stored documents (1) A class of electronically stored documents may be described by specifying or describing a search term or phrase to be used in a search for electronically stored documents which shall be reasonable in scope (“reasonable search”). A request for the giving of discovery by describing a class of electronically stored documents with reference to search terms or phrases must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search; such limits shall include at least the following: (a) specifying or describing custodians and repositories, eg physical or logical storage locations, media or devices; and (b) specifying the period during which the requested electronically stored documents were created, received or modified. (2) Subject to paragraph 48 (Proportionality and economy), requests for reasonable searches shall not extend to electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible unless the conditions in this paragraph are met. A party requesting a reasonable search for electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible must demonstrate that the relevance and materiality of the electronically stored documents justify the cost and burden of retrieving and producing them. (3) The obligations of a party responding to a request for reasonable search for electronically stored documents is fulfilled upon that party carrying out the search to the extent stated in the request and disclosing any electronically stored documents located as a result of that search. The party giving discovery shall not be required to review the search results for relevance. Applications to Court (4) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted. (5) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible must: (a) specify or describe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted; and (b) be supported by an affidavit demonstrating that the relevance and materiality of the electronically stored documents sought to be discovered justify the cost and burden of retrieving and producing them. Review for the purpose of asserting privilege (6) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party giving discovery from reviewing the discoverable electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose of identifying privileged documents.

(2) An electronic copy of an electronically stored document which reflects that document accurately, or which has been manifestly or consistently acted on, relied upon or used as an accurate copy of that electronic document may be identified in the list of documents as an original. (3) Where the party giving discovery objects to the production of certain discoverable electronically stored documents solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata information is protected by privilege, he must state in the list of documents whether he objects to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information. If he does not object to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information, he must enumerate the electronic documents in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the list of documents.

"text": "60. Swearing or affirming of documents by deponents who are blind or illiterate in English (1) Rule 8 of the Commissioners for Oaths Rules (Cap. 322, Rule 3) restricts advocates and solicitors who are appointed as commissioners for oaths to taking affidavits or statutory declarations, or administering oaths, for deponents who speak and understand English. In view of this, many deponents who are illiterate in English are brought by solicitors to Supreme Court commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits and statutory declarations. As the Supreme Court commissioners for oaths are under a duty to ensure that the deponent understands the document being deposed to, they are obliged to interpret the document to intended deponents; this is also the case in relation to blind deponents. This necessary exercise may take a considerable time and may cause long delays for other persons who wish to take affidavits or statutory declarations before the Supreme Court commissioners for oaths. (2) Accordingly, solicitors who wish to bring illiterate or blind deponents before the Supreme Court commissioners for oaths should first estimate the time that will be taken to interpret the document or documents to be deposed to. If it is estimated that the total time required for interpretation of the documents will be more than 20 minutes, the solicitor must contact the appropriate Supreme Court Head Interpreter and arrange for a special appointment for the documents to be sworn or affirmed. The solicitor should not bring the deponent before the duty commissioner for oaths without such an appointment. (3) If an illiterate or a blind deponent is brought before the duty Supreme Court commissioner for oaths and the interpretation of the document or documents takes more than 20 minutes, the commissioner for oaths will refer the solicitor and the deponent to the appropriate Head Interpreter for a special appointment to be made for the documents to be deposed to. (4) The appropriate Supreme Court Head Interpreter may be contacted at the following telephone numbers: (a) Head Interpreter (Chinese languages) - 6332 3940. (b) Head Interpreter (Indian languages) - 6332 3930. (c) Head Interpreter (Malay languages) - 6332 3970."

"text": "66. Fixing of hearing dates (1) To assist the Registrar at the fixing of hearing dates, solicitors should provide updated information as to the current status of the cause or matter, including the prospects of settlement and any other developments which are likely to affect the length of the trial. In order to facilitate a more realistic assessment of the time required for the hearing, they will also be required to inform the Registrar of the number of witnesses they intend to call, whether any witness will require interpretation services, the estimated amount of time required for each party to cross-examine all the opposing party’s witnesses and the estimated total length of hearing. (2) Solicitors who attend the fixing should be fully acquainted with the cause or matter being fixed for hearing. They should preferably be the solicitor having conduct of the cause or matter. (3) Solicitors must attend the fixing. It is not acceptable for their clerks to attend in their stead. (4) The attention of solicitors is drawn to Order 34, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, which provides: It shall be the duty of all parties to an action entered in any list to furnish without delay to the Registrar all available information as to the action being or being likely to be settled, or affecting the estimated length of the trial, and, if the action is settled or withdrawn, to notify the Registrar of the fact without delay. [emphasis added] (5) Further, parties are to note that any request for an early hearing date for any application, cause or matter is subject to the discretion and availability of the Court. In deciding when to fix an application, cause or matter for hearing or render its decision in any application, cause or matter, the Court is not obliged to give effect to any private agreement between parties on timelines and hearing dates."

(2) Subject to any directions of the Court, when a case is adjourned, the Registrar shall assign such days as are available for the hearing of the case, and counsel will be expected to take the dates at short notice. (3) In the event that the hearing of a case is not concluded within the number of days allotted, the Court may direct the hearing of the case to continue beyond the allotted time, rather than adjourning the case part-heard to another date. Counsel for parties in all cases should therefore be prepared to continue with the hearing of the matter notwithstanding the fact that the time originally allotted may have expired."

"text": "68. Adjournment or vacation of hearings other than trials (1) Before solicitors make a Request through the Electronic Filing Service to the Court for an adjournment or vacation of any hearings other than trials, they should seek the consent of the other party or parties to the matter. Unilateral requests made without first seeking the consent or views of the other party or parties to the matter will not be entertained, except in the most exceptional circumstances. (2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, the Request electronic form should be filed through the Electronic Filing Service at least 2 working days before the hearing, setting out the reasons for the requested adjournment or vacation of hearings. (3) Where an adjournment of any matter before the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division is sought, the Request in electronic form should be ﬁled through the Electronic Filing Service as soon as practicable after the sitting in which the matter is scheduled to be heard has been assigned and notiﬁed to the parties. Where there is a delay in the making of the request, the reason or reasons for the delay must be provided with the request. Any request for an adjournment on account of counsel’s diaries will not readily be acceded to. (4) If the consent of all other parties to the matter is obtained, a letter stating that all parties have consented to the requested adjournment or vacation of hearings may be attached to the Request electronic form. However, this does not mean that the Request will be granted as a matter of course. The Court will still evaluate the merits of the Request before making its decision. (5) If the consent of one or more of the other parties is not obtained, the letter should set out the reasons for the other parties’ objections, or explain why the consent of one or more of the other parties cannot be obtained. Any relevant correspondence between the parties should also be attached to the Request electronic form. The Court will then evaluate the contents of the Request and the relevant correspondence before deciding whether the requested adjournment or vacation of hearings should be allowed. (6) In any other case, solicitors on record for all parties must attend before the Court to make an application for an adjournment. See also paragraph 13 of these Practice Directions."

"text": "69. Filing of documents and authorities for use in Court (1) Subject to any directions in these Practice Directions to the contrary, in particular paragraphs 71(3) and 104, all documents for use at any hearing in Court must be filed using the Electronic Filing Service at least 1 clear day in advance of the hearing. These documents include written submissions, skeletal arguments, bundles of documents, bundles of pleadings, bundles of affidavits, core bundles and all opening statements. (2) In the event that it is not possible to file the documents in advance of the hearing, counsel may apply to the Judge or Registrar conducting the hearing for leave to use paper documents during the hearing. The paper documents may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. The solicitor must explain why it was not possible to file the documents in advance of the hearing, and must also give an undertaking to file using the Electronic Filing Service all the documents used at the hearing by the next working day after the hearing. Any document not filed using the Electronic Filing Service will not be included in the Court’s case file. Bundle of authorities (3) Bundles of authorities may be filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed using the Electronic Filing Service. A party may also choose not to file bundles of authorities and may instead use these for hearings in paper form according to the directions in this Part. (4) The party using the paper copy of the bundle of authorities shall bear the onus of producing the bundle at every hearing at which it is required. The paper copy of the bundle of authorities may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. The Court will neither retain nor undertake to produce for hearings the paper copy of the bundle. The Judge or Registrar may, if he or she so chooses, retain the paper copy of the bundle of authorities for his or her own reference. The paper copy so retained will not, however, form part of the Court’s record in respect of the proceedings in which it was used. (5) Counsel must adhere to the following directions when preparing bundles of authorities for use in Court. These requirements shall also apply to paragraphs 71 to 73 of these Practice Directions: (a) The bundle of authorities shall have a table of contents immediately after the first title page. Where the bundle of authorities consists of more than one volume, each volume shall have a table of contents clearly indicating the authorities that are contained in that volume. (b) The items in the table of contents shall be numbered sequentially, and bound in the order in which they are listed. (c) The table of contents shall contain a concise statement of the relevance of each authority to the specific issues before the Court. The relevance of each authority shall be succinctly expressed and comprise no more than 3 sentences. The statement shall be set out immediately after the name of the case. For example: Cartier International BV v Lee Hock Lee and another application [1992] 3 SLR 340 Relevance: Where the Court is asked to punish an alleged contemnor by incarceration, the charge against him must be proved to the high standard required in a criminal charge. Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 Relevance: Choice of law considerations are relevant even when determining the natural forum to hear a dispute. (6) The Court may reject bundles of authorities that are not in compliance with sub-paragraph (5) above, and in exercising its discretion as to costs, take such non-compliance into account. (7) Where electronic bundles of authorities are filed through the Electronic Filing Service, the following shall apply: (a) A bookmark should be created in the Portable Document Format (PDF) file for each authority in the bundle. (b) The name given to each bookmark should be the same as the table of contents. (c) The page number of each printed bundle must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that bundle. Each separate bundle of documents shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively."

(2) In addition, parties should endeavour to file a core bundle of documents. This core bundle should comprise only documents that are relevant to the hearing in question, or which will be referred to in the course of the hearing. (3) These documents must be prepared in an electronic format. If there are other documents, the relevance of which is uncertain, these documents should be included and any objections taken before the trial Judge. Directions for electronic creation and filing of bundles of documents (4) The following directions shall apply to the filing of bundles: (a) Index pages shall be prepared. Bookmarks should be created in the Portable Document Format (PDF) file for each such reference in the index. There should be as many bookmarks in that PDF file as there are references in the index to documents in that PDF file. (b) The name given to each bookmark should be the same as the corresponding reference in the index. (c) The various PDF documents should be arranged chronologically or in some logical order. (d) The page number of each bundle of documents must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that bundle. Each separate bundle of documents shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively. (5) For proceedings using the Electronic Filing Service, a bundle of documents may be created online and filed through the Electronic Filing Service. The electronic bundle shall be created in Portable Document Format (PDF). The electronic bundle may contain: (a) documents in the electronic case file; and (b) documents that have been uploaded into the electronic case file by solicitors or other persons given access to the shared folder in the electronic case file."

"text": "71. Documents for use in trials of writ actions in open Court (1) This paragraph shall apply to trials in open Court of: (a) writ actions; and (b) originating summonses ordered to be continued as if the cause of action had been begun by writ. (2) Order 34, Rule 3A of the Rules of Court requires the originals of the affidavits of the evidence-in-chief of all witnesses, a bundle of documents and the opening statements to be filed not less than 5 working days before the trial of an action. In addition, to improve the conduct of civil proceedings and to reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the respective solicitors of the parties shall also prepare a bundle of authorities, which shall also be filed and served along with the documents on all relevant parties. Only opening statement to be filed through the Electronic Filing Service (3) The opening statement must be filed in Court as a separate document using the Electronic Filing Service. With the exception of opening statements, the following documents need not be filed through the Electronic Filing Service: (a) The affidavits of the evidence-in-chief of all witnesses and the bundle of documents may be tendered to the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court in hard copy together with an electronic copy stored on a CD-ROM in Portable Document Format (PDF) and complying with the provisions of this paragraph. (b) A party may choose not to include the bundles of authorities in the CD-ROM and may instead tender it in hard copy. (4) Any Court fees payable, pursuant to Appendix B of the Rules of Court, on filing the documents in this sub-paragraph, shall be payable at the cashier at the Legal Registry. Parties should, when making payment at the cashier, indicate to the cashier the precise number of pages which comprise the documents. (5) Payment of the Court fees on such documents should be made before the documents are filed in Court in compliance with Order 34, Rule 3A. As such, the hard copy of documents tendered to Court should show, on the front page, the amount of Court fees paid on the document. (6) The electronic copy must tally in all respects with the hard copy, as it will be uploaded into the case file by the Legal Registry staff and will form part of the electronic case file. The page numbers of the hard copy must correspond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version. Unnecessarily large electronic files should not be submitted. Parties should adhere as far as possible to the guidelines set out on the Electronic Filing Service website (www.elitigation.sg) on the resolution to be used when scanning documents into PDF. (7) In the event that parties elect to electronically file such documents, they must nevertheless tender a bundle of these documents to the Legal Registry in hard copy. It shall not be necessary to pay any additional Court fees in respect of the hard copy in such circumstances. Timeline for filing documents (8) Parties are to note that the timeline in Order 34, Rule 3A (ie. not less than 5 days before the trial) is to be adhered to strictly, and that it will in particular apply to the electronic copy on CD-ROM and the filing of the opening statement as a separate document. (9) At the trial of the cause or matter, an adjournment may be ordered if: (a) the documents or any of them (save for the opening statement in cases where it is not required or dispensation was granted) were not filed and served within the prescribed time or at all; or (b) one party seeks to tender any of the above documents or supplements thereto (except for supplements to the opening statement at the trial of the cause or matter). (10) If an adjournment is ordered for any of the reasons set out in sub-paragraph (9), the party in default may be ordered to bear the costs of the adjournment. Bundles of documents (11) The bundle of documents required to be filed by Order 34, Rule 3A should be paginated consecutively throughout at the top right hand corner and may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. (a) An index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 10 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions must also be furnished. No bundle of documents is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any document at the trial. (b) Under Order 34, Rule 3A(3) it is the responsibility of solicitors for all parties to agree and prepare an agreed bundle as soon as possible. The scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the agreed bundle. (c) The documents in the bundles should: (i) be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding. The rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back; (ii) have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be made in the course of hearing. Such flags shall bear the appropriate indicium by which the document is indicated in the index of contents. Flags shall be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that, as far as possible, they do not overlap one another; and (iii) be legible. Clear and legible photocopies of original documents may be exhibited instead of the originals provided the originals are made available for inspection by the other parties before the hearing and by the Judge at the hearing. (d) Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should be stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies. (e) Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person. (f) A core bundle should also be provided, unless one is clearly unnecessary. The core bundle should contain the most important documents upon which the case will turn or to which repeated reference will have to be made. The documents in this bundle should not only be paginated but should also be cross-referenced to copies of the documents included in the main bundles. The bundle supplied to the Court should be contained in a loose-leaf file which can easily have further documents added to it if required. Bundles of authorities (12) In addition to requirements set out in paragraph 69(5) of these Practice Directions, the bundle of authorities must: (a) contain all the authorities, cases, statutes, subsidiary legislation and any other materials relied on; (b) be arranged in the following order – statutes in alphabetical order of the title, subsidiary legislation in alphabetical order of the title, cases in alphabetical order of the case name, secondary materials (such as textbooks and articles) in alphabetical order of the last name of the author, and any other materials in alphabetical order of the title or last name of the author as is appropriate; (c) be properly bound with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding. The rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back; (d) have flags to mark out the authorities. Such flags shall bear the appropriate indicium by which the authority is referred to. Flags shall be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as far as possible they do not overlap one another; (e) be paginated consecutively at the top right hand corner of each page. Pagination should commence on the first page of the first bundle and run sequentially to the last page of the last bundle; and (f) contain an index of the authorities in that bundle and be appropriately flagged for easy reference; and (g) be legible. Clear legible photocopies of original authorities may be exhibited instead of the originals provided the originals are made available for inspection by the other parties before the hearing and by the Judge at the hearing. (13) Only authorities which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles. No bundle of authorities is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any authority at the trial. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary authorities, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person. Opening statements (14) A proper opening statement is of great assistance to the Court as it sets out the case in a nutshell, both as to facts and law. It is intended to identify both for the parties and the Judge the issues that are, and are not, in dispute. It enables the Judge to appreciate what the case is about, and what he is to look out for when reading and listening to the evidence that will follow. The need for brevity is emphasised as opening statements that contain long and elaborate arguments, and citations from and references to numerous authorities, do not serve this purpose. (a) Opening statements will be required from all parties in all cases commenced by writ in the General Division, except where dispensation has been granted by the Court and in motor vehicle accident actions. (b) All opening statements must include the following: (i) the nature of the case generally and the background facts insofar as they are relevant to the matter before the Court and indicating which facts, if any, are agreed; (ii) the precise legal and factual issues involved are to be identified with cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings. These issues should be numbered and listed, and each point should be stated in no more than one or two sentences. The object here is to identify the issues in dispute and state each party’s position clearly, not to argue or elaborate on them; (iii) the principal authorities in support of each legal proposition should be listed, while the key documents and witnesses supporting each factual proposition should be identified; (iv) where there is a counterclaim or third party action, the opening statement must similarly address all issues raised therein; and (v) an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or complicated). (c) In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs or hearing days have been wasted by a poorly drafted opening statement, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person. (d) The following format shall be adhered to when preparing opening statements: (i) all pages shall be paginated, with the first page (including the cover page) numbered as ‘Page 1’ so that the page numbers of the hard copy correspond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version; (ii) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent; (iii) the print of every page shall be double spaced; (iv) each page may be printed on one side or both sides; and (v) every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35 mm in width. (e) All opening statements should not exceed 20 pages (including all annexes and appendices, but excluding the cover page and backing page). (f) Opening statements may be amended at trial, but counsel will be expected to explain the reasons for the amendments."

"url": "/PART-08-Documents-And-Authorities-For-Use-In-Court.html#74-citation-of-judgments",
"text": "74. Citation of judgments (1) The Honourable the Chief Justice has directed that counsel who wish to cite a judgment as authority in support of their oral or written submissions shall adhere to the following directions. These directions are intended to provide guidance to advocates and solicitors as to (a) the extent to which it is necessary to deploy both local and foreign judgments in support of their case; and (b) the practice of citing such judgments. Use of judgments as authorities in submissions (2) Counsel who cite a judgment must state the proposition of law that the judgment establishes and the parts of the judgment that support that proposition. Such statements should not excessively add to the length of the submission but should be sufficient to demonstrate the relevance of that judgment to the argument made. Where counsel wish to cite more than two judgments as authority for a given proposition, there must be a compelling reason to do so, and this reason must be provided by counsel in the submissions. (3) The Court will also pay particular attention to any indication in the cited judgment that the judgment (i) only applied decided law to the facts of the particular case; or (ii) did not extend or add to the existing law. Use of judgments from foreign jurisdictions (4) Judgments from other jurisdictions can, if judiciously used, provide valuable assistance to the Court. However, where there are in existence local judgments which are directly relevant to the issue, such judgments should be cited in precedence to foreign judgments. Relevant local judgments will be accorded greater weight than judgments from foreign jurisdictions. This will ensure that the Courts are not unnecessarily burdened with judgments made in jurisdictions with differing legal, social or economic contexts. (5) In addition, counsel who cite a foreign judgment must: (a) draw the attention of the Court to any local judgment that may be relevant to whether the Court should accept the proposition that the foreign judgment is said to establish; and (b) ensure that such citation will be of assistance to the development of local jurisprudence on the particular issue in question. Citation practice (6) Counsel who cite a judgment must use the official series of the law report(s) or, if the official series is not available, any other law report series in which the judgment was published. Counsel should refrain from referring to (or including in the bundle of authorities) copies of judgments which are printed out from electronic databases, unless (a) such judgments are not available in any law report series; or (b) the print-outs are the exact copies of the judgments in the law report series. The following are examples of law reports that should be used for citation: Jurisdiction Law Reports (in order of preference) (a) Singapore 1. Singapore Law Reports (2010 - ) (SLR current series) 2. Singapore Law Reports (Reissue) SLR (R)) 3. Singapore Law Reports (1965-2009) (SLR 1965-2009) 4. Malayan Law Journal (MLJ) (b) Malaysia Malayan Law Journal (MLJ) (c) England &amp; Wales 1. Law Reports published by the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (e.g. Queen’s Bench (QB), Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), Probate (P) 2. Weekly Law Reports (WLR) 3. All England Law Reports (All ER) (d) Australia 1. Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR) 2. Australian Law Reports (ALR) (e) Canada 1. Supreme Court Reports (SCR) 2. Federal Court Reports (FC) 3. Dominion Law Reports (DLR) (f) New Zealand New Zealand Law Reports (NZLR) (7) Counsel should, where possible, make specific citations by referring to the paragraph number of the judgment, and not to the page number of the judgment or report. For consistency, square brackets ([xx]) should be used to denote paragraph numbers. The paragraph mark (¶) should no longer be used. The neutral citation system for local judgments (8) A neutral citation is a Court-approved system of citation which is independent of the series of law reports or other publication, and unique to each written judgment. Each written judgment from a particular level of Court is assigned a sequential number, starting from 1 at the beginning of each calendar year. The application of the system is as follows: (a) Cases reported in the Singapore Law Reports shall be cited using their Singapore Law Reports citations, in priority to their neutral citations. (b) Unreported decisions shall be cited using their neutral citations. COURT DESIGNATORS SGCA – Singapore Court of Appeal SGHC(A) – Singapore High Court (Appellate Division) SGHC – Singapore High Court (before 2 January 2021) or Singapore High Court (General Division) (on or after 2 January 2021) SGHCR – Singapore High Court Registrar (before 2 January 2021) or Singapore High Court (General Division) Registrar (on or after 2 January 2021) EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION ABC Co Pte Ltd v XYZ Co Ltd [2003] SGCA 5, at [3], [8]. Year of the decision : [2003] Level of Court : SGCA (Singapore Court of Appeal) Sequential Number : 5 (fifth written judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal in 2003) Paragraph Number(s): Paragraphs 3 and 8 of the judgment Ancillary provisions (9) The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs may, where appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the extent to which counsel has complied with this practice direction in the citation of judgments before the Court. (10) It will remain the duty of counsel to draw the attention of the Court to any judgment not cited by an opponent, which is adverse to the case being advanced. (11) In addition, counsel should also comply with paragraphs 71(12) and 71(13) when preparing bundles of authorities for use in trials of writ actions in open Court. (12) This paragraph applies to all hearings, whether in open Court or chambers, in the Supreme Court."

The solicitors should therefore approve the drafts and not submit these drafts to the Registrar for approval. (2) The Registrar’s signature on a judgment or order is only for the purpose of validity and does not in any way affect the regularity or irregularity of the contents of any judgment or order. (3) Subject to sub-paragraph (4), parties in inter partes applications should proceed to engross a final copy of the draft judgment for signature by the Registrar after agreeing on the draft. Draft orders of Court for ex parte applications may be submitted with the summons and the supporting affidavit when these are filed. (4) For draft orders in electronic form that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, the process for extracting judgments and orders shall be as follows: (a) Parties have the option of filing a system-generated order of court through the Electronic Filing Service. (b) Before filing the system-generated order of court, the party extracting the order must: (i) review and edit the order of court electronic form to ensure that it accurately reflects the orders made by the Court; and (ii) obtain the approval of all other parties to the application and provide evidence of such approval when filing the draft order of court, for example, a Portable Document Format (PDF) copy of a draft order of court signed by the solicitors of all parties to the application. (c) Where parties disagree over one or more terms of the order of court, the party filing the draft order of court shall be responsible for including in the order of court electronic form all versions of the disputed terms by editing the order of court electronic form. All relevant correspondence concerning the dispute must be provided when filing the draft order of court. (d) The Registry will seal and issue an engrossed order of court once its terms are approved. (5) Order 42, Rule 8(3), (4) and (5) shall continue to apply: (a) In any case where the solicitors concerned are unable to agree upon the draft, any one of them may obtain an appointment before the Registrar by filing a Request through the Electronic Filing Service, of which notice shall be given to the other, to settle the terms of the judgment or order. (b) For judgments or orders composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, any solicitor may ask the Registrar to settle the terms of the judgment or order. Such solicitor shall be responsible for including in the draft judgment or order electronic form all versions of the disputed terms by editing the judgment or order electronic form prior to seeking an audience before the Registrar. (c) Every judgment or order shall be settled by the Registrar, but in the case of a judgment or order made by a Judge, any party may require the matter in dispute to be referred to the Judge for his determination. (6) Where the other party has no solicitor, the draft shall be submitted to the Registrar."

Judgment in default of appearance or service of defence (1) The previous practice of applying for a search for appearance and obtaining a certificate of non-appearance before judgment in default of appearance is entered is discontinued.

Solicitors’ attention is drawn to Order 13, Rule 7(1) and Order 19, Rule 8A of the Rules of Court, which state: Judgment shall not be entered against a defendant under this Order unless a request to enter judgment in Form 79A is filed with the judgment in Form 79. (3) For Requests to enter judgment electronic forms composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, a signed hard copy of the Request to enter judgment electronic form shall be retained by the solicitor concerned and produced to the Court when required by the Court to do so. (4) In order to satisfy itself that a defendant is in default of appearance or service of defence, the Court may require an affidavit to be filed stating the time and manner service of the Writ of Summons was effected on the defendant, as well as the steps taken to ascertain that the defendant had failed to enter an appearance or serve a defence, as the case may be. (5) For the avoidance of doubt, Requests for entry of default judgment shall be filed as a Portable Document Format (PDF) document for suits where the memorandum of service has been filed before 1 January 2013.

Interest under Order 30, Rule 6(2) (10) The directions set out in sub-paragraph (11) shall apply to orders made under Order 30, Rule 6(2) for payment of interest on or after 1 April 2007.

"text": "87. Filing of records of appeal, core bundles and written Cases for civil appeals under Order 56A, Rules 8 and 9 and Order 57, Rules 9 and 9A of the Rules of Court (1) Under Order 56A, Rule 8(1) and Order 57, Rule 9(1) of the Rules of Court, the appellant is required to ﬁle the record of appeal (or in the case of a further appeal from the Appellate Division, the supplemental record of appeal), the Appellant’s Case and the core bundle. Under Order 56A, Rule 9(2) and (3) and Order 57, Rule 9A(2) and (2A), the respondent has to ﬁle the Respondent’s Case and the Respondent’s supplemental core bundle (if any). Under Order 56A, Rule 9(7) and (9) and Order 57, Rule 9A(5A) and (5C), the appellant may ﬁle an Appellant’s Reply and the Appellant’s supplemental core bundle (if any). The record of appeal (and the supplemental record of appeal, if any), core bundle and supplemental core bundle are collectively referred to in this paragraph as “appeal bundles”. (2) For the purpose of complying with Order 56A, Rules 8 and 9 and Order 57, Rules 9 and 9A, the parties are required to ﬁle the following documents using the Electronic Filing Service in accordance with the speciﬁed time frames in Order 56A, Rules 8(1) and 9(2) and (7) and Order 57, Rules 9(1) and 9A(2) and (5A). (a) The appellant is required to file one copy of the following: (i) Form of the record of appeal in lieu of the record of appeal (except that in the case of a further appeal to the Court of Appeal from the Appellate Division, the appellant is to file the form of the supplemental record of appeal in lieu of the supplemental record of appeal); (ii) Form of the core bundle in lieu of the core bundle; and (iii) Appellant’s Case. (b) The respondent is required to file one copy of the following: (i) Respondent’s Case; and (ii) Form of the Respondent’s supplemental core bundle (if any) in lieu of the supplemental core bundle. (c) Where applicable, the appellant may also file one copy of the following: (i) Appellant’s Reply; and (ii) Form of the Appellant’s supplemental core bundle (if any) in lieu of the supplemental core bundle. (3) The form of the record of appeal, form of the supplemental record of appeal, form of the core bundle and form of the supplemental core bundle (collectively referred to in this paragraph as “forms of appeal bundles”) ﬁled pursuant to sub- paragraph (2) must be in accordance with Forms 12, 12A, 13 and 14 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions. For the avoidance of doubt, the documents contained in the hard copies of the appeal bundles must coincide with the documents listed in the form of the appeal bundles. (4) The attention of parties is also drawn to the Court fees payable under Order 90B read with Appendix B of the Rules of Court, and the importance of brevity and restraint in the compilation of core bundles. (4A) The Chief Justice has further directed that the Appellant’s Case and the Respondent’s Case in civil matters before the Court of Appeal and civil matters before the Appellate Division shall not exceed 50 pages unless leave of the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division (as the case may be) is obtained. The Appellant’s Reply, if any, shall not exceed 30 pages unless leave of the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division (as the case may be) is obtained. The process for obtaining leave of the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division may be found in paragraph 87A of these Practice Directions. Any Appellant’s Case, Respondent’s Case, and Appellant’s Reply in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages. Parties are reminded to comply with Order 56A, Rule 9 and Order 57, Rule 9A of the Rules of Court (as the case may be) in respect of the preparation of their Cases, and the Appellant’s Reply, as well as the following requirements: (a) all pages should be paginated, with the page numbers corresponding to the Portable Document Format version of the Case or the Appellant’s Reply, as the case may be; (b) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent; (c) the print of every page shall be double-spaced; and (d) every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35 mm in width. (4B) Parties are to take note of the following when preparing their Cases: (a) Parties should ensure that all documents which they refer to in their submissions (whether in their Cases or in the oral submissions) are contained in the core bundle or the supplemental core bundle. As a matter of practice, parties should not be making submissions based on documents contained solely in the record of appeal or the supplemental record of appeal unless they are responding to questions from the coram; and (b) Any document referred to in a Case should be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the court to identify the nature of the document. Parties’ attention is drawn to paragraph 89(5A) for illustrations of suitable descriptions. (5) If a party wishes to rely on a document which does not exist in the electronic case file, he must file the document together with the respective forms of appeal bundles. Further, a table of contents must be included for these documents. These documents must be paginated consecutively at the centre top of the page and the solicitor must ensure that the pagination takes into account the pages comprising the respective forms of appeal bundles and the table of contents for these additional documents. For example, if the form of the core bundle is 5 pages and the table of contents for the additional documents is 2 pages, the first page of the first document should be paginated as page 8. (6) When the core bundles and supplemental core bundles are tendered at the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court pursuant to paragraph 88(1), the Legal Registry staff will state on the top right hand corner of the bundle the exact amount of Court fees payable under Order 90B. The parties should then pay the Court fees as indicated."

Preparation of appeal records in civil appeals to the Court of Appeal and civil appeals to the Appellate Division Arrangement (1) This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of arranging appeal records. (a) To facilitate cross-referencing, the record of appeal shall be arranged in the following separate volumes: (i) Volume I – Judgment or grounds of decision and the engrossed order of Court of judgment appealed from. (ii) Volume II – Notice of appeal, certificate of security for costs and pleadings (to include all originating processes). (iii) Volume III – Affidavits (in chronological order), and transcripts or notes of evidence and arguments. (iv) Volume IV – All such exhibits and documents as they were tendered in the Court below, but which did not form an exhibit to any affidavit. (v) Volume V – The Agreed Bundle (if any) in its original physical form as it was tendered in the Court below. (b) Where there are no exhibits or documents referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(a)(iv) above, Volume IV need not be produced, and Volume V shall be renumbered as Volume IV. (ba) To facilitate cross-referencing, any supplemental record of appeal shall be arranged in the following manner in one volume: (i) the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal; (ii) the certificate of payment of security for costs in respect of the appeal to the Court of Appeal; (iii) the record of proceedings before the Appellate Division mentioned in Order 57, Rule 5(3); (iv) the order granting leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal; and (v) the Cases filed under Order 56A, Rule 9. (c) If any volume should exceed 300 pages, then that volume shall be sub-divided, at a convenient page, into sub-volumes designated as part thereof, for example, Volume III Part A, Volume III Part B and so on. Conversely, if any of the volumes (with the exception of Volumes I and II which shall remain as separate volumes) should be less than 100 pages each, these may be amalgamated into combined volumes, each not exceeding 300 pages, and renumbered accordingly. (d) The following additional directions shall apply to the form of the record of appeal: (i) The documents in Volumes I, II, and III shall be arranged strictly in the order stated in sub-paragraph (1)(a) above. (ii) The documentary exhibits in Volume IV shall be arranged in the most convenient way for the use of the Court, as the circumstances of the case require. The documents shall, as far as suitable, be arranged in chronological order, mixing plaintiff’s and defendant’s documents together when necessary (for example, in a series of correspondence). If proceedings in a suit other than the one under appeal appear as exhibits, then these shall be kept together. However, the documents from each suit shall be arranged in the chronological order of the suits. (iii) Each document in Volume IV shall show its exhibit mark and whether it is the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s document, unless this is clear from the mark. Pagination in soft copy (2) This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of paginating soft copy appeal records. (a) The first page of each volume shall state the title and the Civil Appeal number of the appeal, the names of the parties, the volume number, a short description of its contents, the names and addresses of the appellants and respondents, and the date of filing. (b) The page number of each volume of the appeal records must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that volume. Each separate volume of the appeal records shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively. If separator sheets are used, these shall also be numbered. Table of contents (3) This sub-paragraph sets out the format of the table of contents for appeal records. (a) The table of contents of all volumes of the records shall be placed at the beginning of Volume I, immediately after the first title page in the manner and form set out in Form 15 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions. (b) Each volume and, if any, parts thereof, shall also contain its own index of the contents. (c) Items in the table of contents shall be numbered serially, and listed in the order in which they are found in the records. (d) The items relating to the transcripts or notes of the evidence of witnesses shall have a sub-table of contents of the evidence of each witness, and the number and name of each witness shall be shown in such sub-table. (e) If an exhibit consists of a bundle of documents, then the documents in the bundle shall be listed in a sub-table of contents under the item relating to such bundle. (f) Electronic bookmarks for each item of the table of contents and sub-table of contents must be added to each volume of the PDF version of the appeal records. The description of each bookmark shall correspond with the description of that item in the table of contents or sub-table of contents, unless an abbreviated description is appropriate. Spacing (4) The line spacing on every page of the records of which the original is typed-written (for example, notice of appeal) shall be double-spaced. Core bundles – Order 56A, Rule 8(3) and Order 57, Rule 9(2A) (5) The documents to be included in the core bundle are stipulated in Order 56A, Rule 8(3) and Order 57, Rule 9(2A). The contents of the core bundle shall be arranged in the following separate volumes: (a) Volume I – a copy of the grounds of the judgment or order, the judgment or order appealed from and an index of the documents included therein. (b) Volume II – all other documents referred to in Order 56A, Rule 8(3) or Order 57, Rule 9(2A) (as the case may be), and an index of the documents included therein. Each volume of the core bundle shall begin at page 1, every page shall be numbered and the page number of the core bundle shall correspond to the page number of the PDF version. Index of core bundles and supplemental core bundles (5A) The indexes of the core bundle and supplemental core bundle shall correspond with the indexes of documents found in the form of core bundle and form of supplemental core bundle filed under paragraph 87(2) of these Practice Directions. Any document listed in the indexes should be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the Court to identify the nature of the document. Examples of suitable descriptions are set out below for reference: (a) Joint Venture Agreement between Party A and Party B dated 1 December 2017; (b) Minutes of meeting held on 1 December 2017 between Party A and Party B; and (c) Email dated 1 December 2017 from Party A and Party B. Parties should avoid the use of generic descriptions such as “extracts from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017” or “exhibits from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017”. Responsibility for good order and completeness of appeal records (6) The solicitor having the conduct of the appeal may delegate the preparation of the appeal records to an assistant or a suitably experienced law clerk or secretary, provided always that the solicitor shall personally satisfy himself as to the good order and completeness of every copy of the appeal records lodged in Court in accordance with the above directions, and shall personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies. Superfluous, irrelevant or duplicative documents (7) With regard to the inclusion of documents, the solicitor’s attention is drawn to the provisions of Order 56A, Rule 8(2), (3) and (4) and Order 57, Rule 9(2), (2A) and (3) as well as Order 56A, Rule 9(3) and (9) and Order 57, Rule 9A(2A) and (5C). Only documents which are relevant to the subject matter of the appeal, or, in the case of core bundles and supplemental core bundles, will be referred to in the Cases, shall be included in the appeal records. (8) Parties are reminded not to exhibit duplicate documents in their supplemental core bundle if such documents are already included in a core bundle or supplemental core bundle that has been filed earlier. Documents shall not appear more than once in the records, even if exhibited to different affidavits. (9) The Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division (as the case may be) will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs in cases in which it is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of superﬂuous, irrelevant or duplicative documents."

"text": "89B. Inclusion in appeal bundles of documents ordered to be sealed or redacted (1) This paragraph applies only where certain documents tendered before the court below have been ordered to be sealed or redacted. (2) Counsel should carefully consider whether it is necessary to include in the record of appeal (or, in the case of a further appeal from the Appellate Division, the supplemental record of appeal), core bundle or supplemental core bundle (collectively known as “appeal bundles”) any document that has been ordered to be sealed or redacted, having regard to paragraph 89(7) of these Practice Directions. Inclusion of redacted documents in appeal bundles (3) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be redacted, parties should do so by complying with the following directions: (a) All documents subjected to a redaction order should not be included in the appeal bundles in their unredacted form. Instead, such documents should be included in the appeal bundles in their redacted form. (b) In the margins against the redacted portions of the appeal bundles, the basis for the redaction should be stated (for example, “This information has been redacted pursuant to HC/ORC 1/2017 made on 2 January 2017”). (c) When tendering the appeal bundles, the parties should also tender a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a redaction order. These documents should be included in this bundle in their unredacted form (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Redaction Order” or “BDSRO”). (d) The BDSRO should be tendered in both hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties should tender the number of copies as provided in paragraph 88(1) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSRO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 88(3) of these Practice Directions and should be named in the format provided in paragraph 88(4) of these Practice Directions. (e) The BDSRO should contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents should comply with that provided in paragraph 89(3) of these Practice Directions. (f) The pagination of the documents in the BDSRO should follow the pagination of the corresponding documents in the appeal bundles. Fresh pagination should not be assigned to the documents in the BDSRO. (g) At the time when the parties tender the appeal bundles and the BDSRO, they should by way of a letter to the Legal Registry: (i) inform the Legal Registry that the BDSRO contains redacted information, (ii) specify the basis for the redaction; and (iii) request that the Legal Registry seal the BDSRO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection. (4) Solicitors are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 89(6) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and BDSRO are tendered, the solicitor having conduct of the appeal shall provide an undertaking to the Court that he has satisfied himself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be redacted in its unredacted form. The undertaking shall be in Form 30 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions. Inclusion of sealed documents in appeal bundles (5) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be sealed, parties should do so by complying with the following directions: (a) All documents subjected to a sealing order should not be included in the appeal bundles. Instead, each and every such document should be represented in the appeal bundles by a separate holding page. (b) Each and every holding page should be blank save that: (i) the basis for the sealing should be stated across each holding page (for example, “The affidavit of Tan filed on 30 December 2016 has been sealed pursuant to HC/ORC 1/2017 made on 2 January 2017”); and (ii) the cross-references required under subparagraph 4(f) should be indicated (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”). (c) When tendering the appeal bundles, the parties should also tender a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a sealing order (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Sealing Order” or “BDSSO”). (d) The BDSSO should be tendered both in hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties should tender the number of copies as is provided in paragraph 88(1) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSSO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 88(3) of these Practice Directions and should be named in the format provided in paragraph 88(4) of these Practice Directions. (e) The BDSSO should contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents should comply with that provided in paragraph 89(3) of these Practice Directions. (f) Given that each and every document subjected to a sealing order is represented only by a single holding page in the appeal bundles but is reproduced in full in the BDSSO, fresh pagination will have to be assigned to the pages in the BDSSO. Each holding page should contain cross-references to the pages of the BDSSO that the holding page represents (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”). (h) At the time when the parties tender the appeal bundles and the BDSSO, they must by way of a letter to the Legal Registry: (i) inform the Legal Registry that the BDSSO contains documents ordered to be sealed, (ii) specify the basis for the sealing; and (iii) request that the Legal Registry seal the BDSSO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection. (6) Solicitors are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 89(6) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and the BDSSO are tendered, the solicitor having conduct of the appeal shall provide an undertaking to the Court that he has satisfied himself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be sealed. The undertaking shall be in Form 30 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions. (7) For the avoidance of doubt, documents that have been ordered to be expunged should not in any event be tendered to the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division in any form."

"text": "90. Skeletal arguments for appeals and matters before the General Division, Appellate Division, Court of Appeal and Court of 3 Judges (1) For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph applies to: (a) civil and criminal appeals in the General Division, excluding appeals from the Registrar to a Judge in Chambers; (aa) civil appeals and any other civil matters, before the Appellate Division; (b) civil appeals and any other civil matters, before the Court of Appeal; and (c) criminal appeals and other criminal matters before the Court of Appeal. (2) The term “skeletal arguments” includes “skeletal submissions”, “written submissions”, “written arguments” and all other variant terms by which such documents are known. (3) Counsel should submit skeletal arguments for the hearing of the appeal or matter and give a copy to counsel for the other parties. Hard copies of skeletal arguments may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. (4) Skeletal arguments are abbreviated notes of the arguments that will be presented. Skeletal arguments are not formal documents and do not bind parties. They are a valuable tool to the Judges and are meant to expedite the hearing of the appeal. These notes should comply with the following requirements: (a) they should contain a numbered list of the points proposed to be argued, stated in no more than one or 2 sentences; (b) each listed point should be accompanied by a full reference to the material to which counsel will be referring, i.e., the relevant pages or passages in authorities, the record of appeal (or the supplemental record of appeal), the bundles of documents, aﬃdavits, transcripts and the judgment under appeal; (c) for civil appeals and any other civil matters before the Court of Appeal, and civil appeals and any other civil matters before the Appellate Division, the final paragraph(s) should contain the parties’ submissions on costs, stating (with reasons) the appropriate costs order and the quantum (including the disbursements incurred) that should be awarded by the Court; (d) all pages should be paginated, with the first page (not including any cover page) numbered as “Page 1”; (e) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent; (f) the print of every page shall be double-spaced; and (g) every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35mm in width. Skeletal arguments for civil matters before the Court of Appeal and civil matters before the Appellate Division (5) The need for parties to avoid prolixity in their “skeletal arguments” is emphasised. All skeletal arguments in civil matters before the Court of Appeal, and civil matters before the Appellate Division, shall not exceed 20 pages. Any skeletal arguments in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages. (6) Where the appeal or matter is before the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division, the skeletal arguments must be ﬁled by 4 p.m. on the Monday three weeks before the start of the sitting period of the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division (as the case may be) within which that appeal or matter is scheduled for hearing, regardless of the actual day (within that sitting period) on which that appeal or matter is scheduled for hearing before the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division. (For example, if the sitting period of the Court of Appeal starts on Monday, 18 February 2019 and ends on Friday, 8 March 2019, all skeletal arguments for appeals or matters listed before the Court of Appeal in that sitting period must be ﬁled by 4 p.m. on Monday, 28 January 2019.) The skeletal arguments should be ﬁled by tendering 4 hard copies to the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court and ﬁling one soft copy through the Electronic Filing Service. Skeletal arguments ﬁled in breach of this timeline will be rejected. (7) As with other non-compliance with timelines, costs may be imposed against the party in default or his counsel personally in the event of non-compliance with sub-paragraph (6) above. Unless approval for late filing has been granted, the party in default may not file or tender these skeletal arguments in Court. (8) Parties whose skeletal arguments have been rejected for filing may re-file their skeletal arguments, provided they comply with sub-paragraphs (4) to (7) above. Further skeletal arguments for civil and criminal matters before the Court of Appeal and civil matters before the Appellate Division (8A) Where the Court of Appeal orders further skeletal arguments (including any submissions on costs) to be ﬁled for any civil or criminal matter, such skeletal arguments shall not exceed 10 pages unless otherwise directed by the Court of Appeal. Where the Appellate Division orders further skeletal arguments (including any submissions on costs) to be filed for any civil matter, such skeletal arguments shall not exceed 10 pages unless otherwise directed by the Appellate Division. Any skeletal arguments ﬁled in breach of any requirement in this sub-paragraph will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages. Timelines for submission of skeletal arguments for appeal before the General Division (9) Where the appeal is a civil appeal before the General Division, the skeletal arguments should be sent to the Legal Registry at least 2 working days before the hearing of the appeal. (10) Where the appeal is a criminal appeal before the General Division, the skeletal arguments should be sent to the Legal Registry at least 10 days before the hearing of the appeal. Skeletal arguments filed in breach of this timeline will be stamped “Late Submission”. Application of this paragraph to Court of 3 Judges (11) Sub-paragraphs (1) to (8A) also apply to disciplinary proceedings, or appeals therefrom, brought under any statute, including the Legal Profession Act 1966 and the Medical Registration Act 1997, which are heard by a Court of 3 Judges."

(2) The Honourable the Chief Justice has therefore directed that as a general rule, unless asked for by the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division itself, the Court of Appeal and the Appellate Division will not receive further arguments after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal.

"text": "94. Form of bill of costs The attention of solicitors is drawn to Rules 24 and 31 and Appendix 1 of Order 59 of the Rules of Court. In addition, solicitors are to abide by the following requirements: Margin (1) A blank margin not less than 10 mm wide on all four sides is required for each page of the bill of costs. Pagination (2) Every page of a bill of costs shall be paginated consecutively at the centre of the top of the page. Format (3) This sub-paragraph sets out the format of a bill of costs. PARTY-AND-PARTY BILLS (a) For party-and-party bills: (i) A bill of costs drawn up for taxation between one party to proceedings and another should be divided into 3 separate sections as required by Order 59, Rule 24. (ii) Form 16 in Appendix A of these Practice Directions should be used for contentious business in respect of work done for a trial or in contemplation of a trial. (iii) Form 17 should be used for contentious business in respect of, or in contemplation of, work done other than for a trial; such as work done for an appeal or for a specific interlocutory application. (iv) Form 18 should be used for non-contentious business. SPECIMEN BILLS (b) Specimen bills illustrating the use of Forms 16, 17 and 18 are found in Appendix C of these Practice Directions. SOLICITOR-AND-OWN CLIENT BILLS (c) A bill of costs drawn up for taxation between a solicitor and his own client should be drawn up in the same manner described in sub-paragraph (3)(a) save as follows: (i) A solicitor will be deemed to have indicated that all items included in the bill are in relation to work done or disbursements incurred with the approval of the client. (ii) Any agreement, whether oral or in writing, between the solicitor and his own client relating to the amount of costs payable either as a global sum or in respect of particular items included in the bill should be indicated on the bill. Any agreement between the solicitor and his own client as to the rate to be used to compute the solicitor’s costs should also be indicated in the bill. BILLS OF COSTS REQUIRED TO BE TAXED UNDER SECTION 18(3) OF THE MOTOR VEHICLES (THIRD-PARTY RISKS AND COMPENSATION) ACT 1960 (d) Whenever a solicitor-and-own-client bill is required to be taxed by virtue of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act 1960, a bill should be drawn up for taxation between the solicitor and his own client and another bill drawn up for taxation between the client and the other party to the proceedings in which the solicitor acted for the client. A waiver of the filing fees for the solicitor-and–own-client bill may be requested when this bill is filed. (i) The party-and-party bill should be filed first and the solicitor-and-own-client bill should reference the first bill. (ii) The party-and-party bill and the solicitor-and-own client bill can be drawn up as described in sub-paragraphs (3)(a) and (3)(c) with the modification set out in sub-paragraph (3)(d)(iii) below. (iii) It is not necessary to repeat serially in the solicitor-and-own-client bill the items which have already been serially set out in the party-and-party bill. It is sufficient, ordinarily, to incorporate all such items by reference and proceed to set out in detail any additional items, i.e. items not already set out in the party-and-party bill. However, if a sum claimed for an item of disbursement in the solicitor-and-own-client bill is different from the corresponding sum claimed in the party-and-party bill, it will be necessary to set out serially again in the solicitor-and-own-client bill all the items of disbursement already set out in the party-and-party bill (including, where appropriate, the different sum or sums claimed) as well as additional items of disbursement not so set out. In addition, the global sums claimed for sections 1 and 2 of the solicitor-and-own-client bill should be indicated at the end of the respective sections whether or not they are the same sums as those claimed for sections 1 and 2 of the party-and-party bill. Particulars (4) Sufficient particulars must be included in the bill of costs so as to enable the Registrar to exercise his discretion under paragraph 1(2) of Appendix 1 to Order 59. Without prejudice to sub-paragraph (3), the Registrar may, at the taxation hearing, order the claiming or receiving party to furnish full details in support of the sums claimed under the bill. Goods and services tax (5) A party claiming goods and services tax (GST) in a bill of costs must comply with the directions set out in this sub-paragraph. A party who fails to comply with the directions set out in this sub-paragraph will be presumed not to be claiming GST in the bill concerned. REGISTRATION NUMBERS (a) For registration numbers, (i) The GST registration number allocated by the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax to the solicitors for the receiving party or parties should appear at the top left-hand corner of the first page of the bill of costs.

(3) Upon the arrest of vessel, funds are required immediately to meet the Sheriff’s expenses, such as security guard charges, port and garbage dues, and the supply of minimum victuals, domestic fuel and water to crew members where necessary. Funds to meet such expenses are not provided for by the Government. (4) To enable the Sheriff to discharge his duties effectively, upon the arrest of a vessel, the Sheriff will require the solicitors representing arresting parties to deposit with the Sheriff a sum of $10,000. Such deposit is in addition to the usual undertaking. (5) During the relevant period as defined in Order 70, Rule 10A(5) of the Rules of Court, the solicitors representing arresting parties must make reasonable efforts to notify the following persons and entities in writing of the service of the warrant of arrest or the writ in an action in rem as soon as practicable after the warrant of arrest or the writ (as the case may be) is served in accordance with Order 70, Rule 10A(1) of the Rules of Court: (a) the owner of the ship; (b) the demise charterer (if any) of the ship; (c) the Master of the ship; (d) the manager of the ship; and (e) if the ship is in a shipyard — the shipyard. (6) For the purposes of Order 70, Rules 10A(3)(a) and (4)(a)(ii) of the Rules of Court, the plaintiff must annex a copy of the results of a search on the ship conducted on the website of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore at https://digitalport.mpa.gov.sg showing: (a) the identity of the agent of the ship; and (b) the location of the ship or, where the property is cargo, the ship in which the cargo was carried, within the limits of the port declared under section 3(1) of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Act 1996, on the date and at the time of the service of the warrant of arrest or the writ in an action in rem (as the case may be). (7) Throughout the arrest of a vessel, the solicitors representing the arresting party must engage ship watch services and provide daily updates to the Sheriff on the location of the vessel. (8) The Sheriff may require the arresting party to deploy a security guard on board the vessel under arrest for the whole or any part of the period when the vessel is under arrest. The circumstances in which the Sheriff may require the deployment of a security guard on board the vessel under arrest include, but are not limited to: (a) the discharge of cargo from the vessel; (b) the moving of the vessel from berth to anchorage, and the other way around; (c) any actual or potential unrest on the vessel; and (d) any other circumstance that may affect the preservation of the vessel."

Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings (1) The Honourable the Chief Justice has made the following orders under section 28A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322): (a) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings to District Court) Order 1996, which came into operation on 1 April 1996 (“the 1996 Transfer Order”); (b) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings to District Court) Order 2003, which came into operation on 15 December 2003 (“the 2003 Transfer Order”); (c) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings to District Court) Order 2005, which came into operation on 1 April 2006 (“the 2005 Transfer Order”); and (d) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings to District Court) Order 2007, which came into operation on 1 January 2008 (“the 2007 Transfer Order”). (2) To improve eﬃciency in the administration of justice and to provide for speedier disposal of proceedings commenced in the High Court before 1 October 2014, pursuant to the 1996 Transfer Order, the 2003 Transfer Order, the 2005 Transfer Order and the 2007 Transfer Order: (a) all proceedings under section 59 and Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353, 2009 Rev. Ed.) and the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap. 122, 1985 Rev. Ed.) (referred to in this Part as “family proceedings”), commenced in the High Court on or after 1 April 1996 but before 1 October 2014, shall be transferred to and be heard and determined by a District Court; and (b) all family proceedings commenced before 1 April 1996 as well as any proceedings ancillary thereto shall continue to be heard and determined by the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021. (3) The transfer of family proceedings to the District Court can result in the District Court hearing family proceedings in which the value of the matrimonial assets concerned far exceeds the normal civil jurisdictional limit of the District Court. Further, to encourage the growth of family law jurisprudence, the 2003 Transfer Order and the 2005 Transfer Order provide that proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter, in which there is a contested application for the division of matrimonial assets asserted by any party to the proceedings to be worth a gross value of $1.5 million or more, shall be transferred from the District Court to the High Court to be heard and determined. This “transfer back” to the High Court based on the gross value of assets applied to proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter commenced on or after 15 December 2003 but before 1 January 2008. (4) There can however be cases where the actual net value of the assets available for matrimonial distribution is in fact much lower than $1.5 million, because of existing liabilities such as an outstanding mortgage loan on the matrimonial property. In order to ensure that the High Court’s resources are utilised to deal only with those cases where the actual value of the matrimonial assets available for distribution is sufficiently high, the 2007 Transfer Order provides that the net value instead of the gross value shall be used to determine whether the proceedings should be transferred from the District Court to the High Court. (5) The new jurisdictional threshold based on net value takes eﬀect from 1 January 2008 and applies to proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter commenced on or after 15 December 2003 but before 1 October 2014. However, proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter which have already been transferred to the High Court based on the gross value threshold, pursuant to the 2003 Transfer Order or the 2005 Transfer Order, will not be aﬀected and will remain in the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021. (6) Practitioners should pay particular attention to the requirement of leave to appeal in the relevant provisions of the 2007 Transfer Order. (7) Practitioners are responsible for identifying the correct Transfer Order applicable to their case. (8) Pursuant to the Family Justice Act 2014, with eﬀect from 1 October 2014, family proceedings shall be heard and determined by the Family Justice Courts. Notwithstanding this, any family proceedings commenced in or transferred to the High Court before 1 October 2014 shall, on and after that date, be continued in and dealt with by the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021."

"text": "150. Notification (1) The definition of “P” in Order 99, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court shall be applicable in these Practice Directions. “P” means a person who lacks or, so far as consistent with the context, is alleged to lack capacity (within the meaning of the MCA) and to whom any proceedings under the MCA relate. (2) Under Order 99, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court, P shall be notified of certain matters by:- (a) the plaintiff, applicant, or appellant (as the case may be); or (b) such other person as the Court may direct. (3) Where P is to be notified that an application has been filed, the person effecting notification must explain to P:- (a) who the plaintiff or applicant is; b) that the application raises the question of whether P lacks capacity in relation to a matter or matters, and what that means; (c) what will happen if the Court makes the order or direction that has been applied for; (d) where the application is for the appointment of a deputy, details of who that person is, and (e) the date on which the application is fixed for hearing. (4) Where P is to be notified that an application has been withdrawn, the person effecting notification must explain to P:- (a) that the application has been withdrawn; and (b) the consequences of that withdrawal. (5) Where P is to be notified that a notice of appeal has been filed, the person effecting notification must explain to P:- (a) who the appellant is; (b) the issues raised by the appeal; (c) what will happen if the appeal is dismissed or allowed; and (d) the date on which the appeal is fixed for hearing. (6) Where P is to be notified that a notice of appeal has been withdrawn, the person effecting notification must explain to P:- (a) that the notice of appeal has been withdrawn; and (b) the consequences of that withdrawal. (7) Where P is to be notified that an order which affects P has been made by the Court, the person effecting notification must explain to P the effect of the order. (8) In all cases of notification, the person effecting notification must provide P with the information required under Order 99, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court and this Part of these Practice Directions in a way that is appropriate to P’s circumstances (for example, using simple language, visual aids or any other appropriate means). (9) The person effecting notification must also inform P that he may seek legal advice and assistance in relation to any matter of which he is notified. (10) The certificate of notification filed under Order 99, Rule 6(5) of the Rules of Court shall be in Form 26 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions. Dispensing with notification (11) Under the MCA, notification of P shall be the norm rather than the exception. However, in certain appropriate circumstances, the person required to notify P may apply to Court for an order to dispense with the requirement to notify P. Such an application would be appropriate where, for example, P is in a permanent vegetative state or a minimally conscious state, or where notification is likely to cause significant and disproportionate distress to P. The reasons for seeking dispensation of notification shall be stated in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant. (12) The Court may, on its own motion, dispense with the notification of P."

This is so regardless of when the accidents or incidents that gave rise to those claims occurred, and regardless of the dates on which the actions were commenced. (2) The Actuarial Tables will serve as a guide and the selection of the appropriate multipliers and the amount of damages awarded remain at the discretion of the Court. Where appropriate on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Court may depart from the multipliers in the Actuarial Tables."
