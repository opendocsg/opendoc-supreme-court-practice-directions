Any affidavit (including exhibits, dividing and backing sheets) exceeding 30 pages shall be bound with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding (the plastic rings or spines to be red for plaintiffs/appellants, and blue for defendants/respondents) with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back.

***Dividing sheets***

(1) The dividing sheet that separates the documentary exhibits shall be in light colour *other than white*, marked, typed or stamped clearly with an exhibit mark as follows:

***More than 10 documentary exhibits***

(2) In addition to the requirements set out in paragraph 59 (except sub-paragraphs 59(5)), when there are more than 10 different documentary exhibits in an affidavit, each document shall be flagged by means of a plastic tag, marked in accordance with the exhibit reference and such flags shall run vertically down the right edge of the exhibits evenly spaced out so as not to overlap one another. The table of contents itself shall bear the top most flag, marked “TABLE”.

## 157. File inspection and obtaining hard copy extracts or certified true copies of documents

(1) In order to inspect a case file in civil proceedings that do not use the Electronic Filing Service, the following procedure should be followed:

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) A <b><i>Request</i></b> should be submitted to obtain leave to inspect the case file. The Request should state the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection. If this person is not a solicitor, his or her identification and contact details should also be included in the Request, and his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) should be produced for verification when requested. The Request should also state the interest that the applicant has in the matter, and the reason for the search or inspection. If the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, the Request should clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter.</li>
	<li>(b) Upon confirmation of the receipt of payment of the fees payable, and once approval for inspection has been received from the Court, the inspection of the case file and Court documents will be carried out at the Registry.</li>
</ul>

(2) Applications to obtain hard copy extracts or certified true copies of documents in civil proceedings that do not use the Electronic Filing Service may be made by submitting a Request to the Legal Registry.

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) The intended use of the hard copy extracts or certified true copies should be clearly stated in the Request. The relevance and necessity of the hard copy extracts or certified true copies in relation to their intended use should also be clearly described.</li>
	<li>(b) The applicant will be informed of the outcome to his or her Request and the fees payable for the provision of the certified true copies if the Request is approved. Upon confirmation of the receipt of payment of the fees payable, the certified true copies will be released to the applicant. The Registry may require verification of the identity of the applicant against his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) prior to release of the certified true copies.</li>
	<li>(c) The fees prescribed by Appendix B to the Rules of Court will be payable for the provision of the above service.</li>
</ul>

(3) The Registry will only accept typewritten Requests which are printed on paper of good quality and signed by the applicant or his or her solicitors concerned. If the Request is not typewritten, it should be handwritten in a clear and legible manner. Otherwise, the Request may be rejected.
