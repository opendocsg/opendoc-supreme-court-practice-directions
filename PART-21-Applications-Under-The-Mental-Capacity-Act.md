	<li>(c) contain a clear opinion on the prognosis of the person concerned and, if necessary, the likelihood of requiring increased or reduced medical expenses in the foreseeable future; and</li>
	<li>(d) be current and should be made not more than 6 months before the  date of the hearing of the application.</li>
</ul>

## 150. Notification

(1) The definition of “P” in Order 99, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court shall be applicable in these Practice Directions. “P” means a person who lacks or, so far as consistent with the context, is alleged to lack capacity (within the meaning of the MCA) and to whom any proceedings under the MCA relate.

(2) Under Order 99, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court, P shall be notified of certain matters by:-

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) the plaintiff, applicant, or appellant (as the case may be); or</li>
	<li>(b) such other person as the Court may direct.</li>
</ul>

(3) Where P is to be notified that an application has been filed, the person effecting notification must explain to P:-

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) who the plaintiff or applicant is;</li>
	<li>b) that the application raises the question of whether P lacks capacity in relation to a matter or matters, and what that means;</li>
	<li>(c) what will happen if the Court makes the order or direction that has been applied for;</li>
	<li>(d) where the application is for the appointment of a deputy, details of who that person is, and</li>
	<li>(e) the date on which the application is fixed for hearing.</li>
</ul>

(4) Where P is to be notified that an application has been withdrawn, the person effecting notification must explain to P:-

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) that the application has been withdrawn; and</li>
	<li>(b) the consequences of that withdrawal.</li>
</ul>

(5) Where P is to be notified that a notice of appeal has been filed, the person effecting notification must explain to P:-
<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) who the appellant is;</li>
	<li>(b) the issues raised by the appeal;</li>
	<li>(c) what will happen if the appeal is dismissed or allowed; and</li>
	<li>(d) the date on which the appeal is fixed for hearing.</li>
</ul>

(6) Where P is to be notified that a notice of appeal has been withdrawn, the person effecting notification must explain to P:-

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) that the notice of appeal has been withdrawn; and</li>
	<li>(b) the consequences of that withdrawal.</li>
</ul>

(7) Where P is to be notified that an order which affects P has been made by the Court, the person effecting notification must explain to P the effect of the order.

(8) In all cases of notification, the person effecting notification must provide P with the information required under Order 99, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court and this Part of these Practice Directions in a way that is appropriate to P’s circumstances (for example, using simple language, visual aids or any other appropriate means).

(9) The person effecting notification must also inform P that he may seek legal advice and assistance in relation to any matter of which he is notified.

(10) The certificate of notification filed under Order 99, Rule 6(5) of the Rules of Court shall be in Form 26 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions.

***Dispensing with notification***

(11) Under the MCA, notification of P shall be the norm rather than the exception. However, in certain appropriate circumstances, the person required to notify P may apply to Court for an order to dispense with the requirement to notify P. Such an application would be appropriate where, for example, P is in a permanent vegetative state or a minimally conscious state, or where notification is likely to cause significant and disproportionate distress to P. The reasons for seeking dispensation of notification shall be stated in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant.

(12) The Court may, on its own motion, dispense with the notification of
P.

## 151. Application subsequent to the appointment of deputy

(1) An application to vary an order made in mental capacity proceedings shall be made by way of summons supported by affidavit and served on every party who had initially been served with the originating summons as well as on the Public Guardian, within 2 working days after the date on which the application is filed.

(2)If an application under sub-paragraph (1) is filed more than 6 months from the date of the order, the application must be served personally on every defendant. If such an application is filed 6 months or less from the date of the order, the service on every party to the proceedings may be by way of ordinary service.

## 152. Where P ceases to lack capacity or dies

(1) Where P ceases to lack capacity or dies, the following steps in sub-paragraphs (2) to (7) may, where relevant, need to be taken to finalise the court’s involvement in P’s affairs.

***Application to end proceedings***

(2) Where P ceases to lack capacity in relation to the matter or matters to which the proceedings relate, an application may be made by any of the following people to the Court to end the proceedings and discharge any orders made in respect of that person:

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) P;</li>
	<li>(b) his litigation representative; or</li>
	<li>(c) any other person who is a party to the proceedings.</li>
</ul>

(3) The application should be supported by evidence that P no longer lacks capacity to make decisions in relation to the matter or matters to which the proceedings relate.

***Applications where proceedings have concluded***

(4) Where P ceases to lack capacity after proceedings have concluded, an application may be made to the Court to discharge any orders made (including an order appointing a deputy or an order in relation to security).

(5) The affidavit filed in support should exhibit the orders sought to be discharged and contain evidence that P no longer lacks capacity to make decisions in relation to the matter or matters to which the proceedings relate.

***Procedure to be followed when P dies***

(6) An application for final directions (including discharging an order appointing a deputy or discharging the security) may be made following P’s death. The application should be supported by an affidavit exhibiting a copy of P’s death certificate.

***Discharge of security***

(7) The Public Guardian may require a deputy to submit a final report upon P ceasing to lack capacity or P’s death. If security has been ordered by the Court,  the Court must be satisfied that the Public Guardian either does not require a final report or is satisfied with the final report provided by the deputy before the said security can be discharged.
