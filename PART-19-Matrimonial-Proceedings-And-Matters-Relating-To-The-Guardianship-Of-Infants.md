## 138. Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings

(1) The Honourable the Chief Justice has made the following orders under section 28A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322):

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings to District Court) Order 1996, which came into operation on 1 April 1996 (“the 1996 Transfer Order”);</li>
	<li>(b) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings to District Court) Order 2003, which came into operation on 15 December 2003 (“the 2003 Transfer Order”);</li>
	<li>(c) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings to District Court) Order 2005, which came into operation on 1 April 2006 (“the 2005 Transfer Order”); and</li>
	<li>(d) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship of Infants Proceedings to District Court) Order 2007, which came into operation on 1 January 2008 (“the 2007 Transfer Order”).</li>
</ul>

(2) To improve eﬃciency in the administration of justice and to provide for speedier disposal of proceedings commenced in the High Court before 1 October 2014, pursuant to the 1996 Transfer Order, the 2003 Transfer Order, the 2005 Transfer Order and the 2007 Transfer Order:

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) all proceedings under section 59 and Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) and the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap. 122) (referred to in this Part as “family proceedings”), commenced in the High Court on or after 1 April 1996 but before 1 October 2014, shall be transferred to and be heard and determined by a District Court; and</li>
	<li>(b) all family proceedings commenced before 1 April 1996 as well as any proceedings ancillary thereto shall continue to be heard and determined by the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021.</li>
</ul>

(3) The transfer of family proceedings to the District Court can result in the District Court hearing family proceedings in which the value of the matrimonial assets concerned far exceeds the normal civil jurisdictional limit of the District Court. Further, to encourage the growth of family law jurisprudence, the 2003 Transfer Order and the 2005 Transfer Order provide that proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter, in which there is a contested application for the division of matrimonial assets asserted by any party to the proceedings to be worth a gross value of $1.5 million or more, shall be transferred from the District Court to the High Court to be heard and determined. This “transfer back” to the High Court based on the gross value of assets applied to proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter commenced on or after 15 December 2003 but before 1 January 2008.

(4) There can however be cases where the actual net value of the assets available for matrimonial distribution is in fact much lower than $1.5 million, because of existing liabilities such as an outstanding mortgage loan on the matrimonial property. In order to ensure that the High Court’s resources are utilised to deal only with those cases where the actual value of the matrimonial assets available for distribution is sufficiently high, the 2007 Transfer Order provides that the net value instead of the gross value shall be used to determine whether the proceedings should be transferred from the District Court to the High Court.

(5) The new jurisdictional threshold based on net value takes eﬀect from 1 January 2008 and applies to proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter commenced on or after 15 December 2003 but before 1 October 2014. However, proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter which have already been transferred to the High Court based on the gross value threshold, pursuant to the 2003 Transfer Order or the 2005 Transfer Order, will not be aﬀected and will remain in the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021.

(6) Practitioners should pay particular attention to the requirement of leave to appeal in the relevant provisions of the 2007 Transfer Order.

(7) Practitioners are responsible for identifying the correct Transfer Order applicable to their case.

(8) Pursuant to the Family Justice Act 2014 (Act No. 27 of 2014), with eﬀect from 1 October 2014, family proceedings shall be heard and determined by the Family Justice Courts. Notwithstanding this, any family proceedings commenced in or transferred to the High Court before 1 October 2014 shall, on and after that date, be continued in and dealt with by the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021.

## 139. Transfer of Section 17A(2) Supreme Court of Judicature Act Proceedings

(1) In relation to proceedings which may be heard and determined by the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021 pursuant to section 17A(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (referred to in this Part as “section 17A(2) proceedings”), the Honourable the Chief Justice has made the following orders under section 28A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act:

<ul type="*">
	<li>(a) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Proceedings pursuant to section 17A(2)) Order 1999, which came into operation on 1 August 1999 (“the 1999 Transfer Order”);</li>
	<li>(b) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Proceedings pursuant to section 17A(2)) Order 2004, which came into operation on 1 November 2004 (“the 2004 Transfer Order”); and</li>
	<li>(c) The Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Proceedings pursuant to section 17A(2)) Order 2007, which came into operation on 1 January 2008 (“the 2007 Transfer Order for section 17A(2) proceedings”).</li>
</ul>

(2) To improve eﬃciency in the administration of justice and to provide for more speedy disposal of proceedings commenced in the High Court before 1 October 2014, pursuant to the 1999 Transfer Order, the 2004 Transfer Order and the 2007 Transfer Order, all section 17A(2) proceedings shall be transferred to and be heard and determined by a District Court.

(3) The transfer of section 17A(2) proceedings to the District Court can result in the District Court hearing section 17A(2) proceedings in which the value of the matrimonial assets concerned far exceeds the normal civil jurisdictional limit of the District Court. Further, to encourage the growth of family law jurisprudence, the 2004 Transfer Order provides that section 17A(2) proceedings, in which there is a contested application for the division of matrimonial assets asserted by any party to the proceedings to be worth a gross value of $1.5 million or more, shall be transferred from the District Court to the High Court to be heard and determined. This “transfer back” to the High Court based on the gross value of assets applied to section 17A(2) proceedings commenced on or after 1 November 2004 but before 1 January 2008.

(4) There can however be cases where the actual *net* value of the assets available for matrimonial distribution is in fact much lower than $1.5 million, because of existing liabilities such as an outstanding mortgage loan on the matrimonial property. In order to ensure that the High Court’s resources are utilised to deal only with those cases where the actual value of the matrimonial assets available for distribution is sufficiently high, the 2007 Transfer Order for section 17A(2) proceedings provides that the net value instead of the *gross* value shall be used to determine whether the proceedings should be transferred from the District Court to the High Court.

(5) The new jurisdictional threshold based on net value takes eﬀect from 1 January 2008 and applies to section 17A(2) proceedings commenced on or after 1 November 2004 but before 1 October 2014. However, section 17A(2) proceedings which have already been transferred to the High Court based on the gross value threshold, pursuant to the 2004 Transfer Order, will not be aﬀected and will remain in the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021.

(6) Practitioners should pay particular attention to the requirement of leave to appeal in the relevant provisions of the 2007 Transfer Order for section 17A(2) proceedings.

(7) Practitioners are responsible for identifying the correct Transfer Order applicable to their case.

(8) Pursuant to the Family Justice Act 2014, with eﬀect from 1 October 2014, section 17A(2) proceedings shall be heard and determined by the Family Justice Courts. Notwithstanding this, any section 17A(2) proceedings commenced in or transferred to the High Court before 1 October 2014 shall, on and after that date, be continued in and dealt with by the High Court before 2 January 2021 or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021.

## 140. Documents to be filed at the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court

(1) All documents relating to family proceedings and section 17A(2) proceedings which are to be heard and determined by the High Court before 2 January 2021, or the General Division on or after 2 January 2021, shall be ﬁled at the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court. These include:

	<li>(d) all applications and documents in or ancillary to section 17A(2) proceedings commenced on or after 1 November 2004 but before 1 October 2014 involving the division of matrimonial assets with a net value of $1.5 million or more, which have been transferred to the High Court upon the direction of the Registrar of the State Courts; and</li>
	<li>(e) all applications and documents to vary any Order of the High Court or the General Division (as the case may be) in the proceedings referred to in sub-paragraphs (1)(a) to (d).</li>
</ul>

(2) Save for the documents listed in sub-paragraph (1), the Legal Registry will cease to accept the filing of the processes in relation to family proceedings with effect from 1 April 1996.

(3) For the avoidance of doubt, all documents relating to family proceedings that are ﬁled at the Legal Registry shall bear the title “In the High Court of the Republic of Singapore” if they are filed before 2 January 2021 or “In the General Division of the High Court of the Republic of Singapore” if they are filed on or after 2 January 2021.

## 141. Forms of orders, including *Mareva* injunctions and search <span title='Formerly known as "Anton Piller order".'><b><i>orders</i></b></span>
