matter, if —

(a) the witness is below the age of 16 years;

(b) it is expressly agreed between the parties to the proceedings that
evidence may be so given;

(c) the witness is outside Singapore; or

(d) the Court is satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of
justice to do so.

(2) In considering whether to grant leave for a witness outside
Singapore to give evidence by live video or live television link under
this section, the Court shall have regard to all the circumstances of
the case including the following:

(a) the reasons for the witness being unable to give evidence in
Singapore;

(b) the administrative and technical facilities and arrangements made at
the place where the witness is to give his evidence; and

(c) whether any party to the proceedings would be unfairly prejudiced.

(3) The Court may, in granting leave under subsection (1), make an order
on all or any of the following matters:

(a) the persons who may be present at the place where the witness is
giving evidence;

(b) that a person be excluded from the place while the witness is giving
evidence;

order is to have effect;

system including compliance with such minimum technical standards as may
be determined by the Chief Justice; and

(h) any other order the Court considers necessary in the interests of
justice.

(4) The Court may revoke, suspend or vary an order made under this
section if —

(a) the live video or live television link system stops working and it
would cause unreasonable delay to wait until a working system becomes
available;

(b) it is necessary for the Court to do so to comply with its duty to
ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly to the parties thereto;

(c) it is necessary for the Court to do so, so that the witness can
identify a person or a thing or so that the witness can participate in
or view a demonstration or an experiment;

proceedings is being heard outside a Courtroom; or

(e) there has been a material change in the circumstances after the
Court has made an order.

particular provision in such an order, if to do so would be inconsistent
with the Court’s duty to ensure that the proceedings are conducted
fairly to the parties to the proceedings.

(6) An order made under this section shall not cease to have effect
merely because the person in respect of whom it was made attains the age
of 16 years before the proceedings in which it was made are finally
determined.

through a live video or live television link by virtue of this section
